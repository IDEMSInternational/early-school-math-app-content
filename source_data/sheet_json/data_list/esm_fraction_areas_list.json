For the diagram on the left, note that the inner square has area 1/4 of the lerger square – as one way to see this, break the whole diagram into little triangles the same size as the ones in the middle. The tricky part of the diagram on the right is that the two triangles have the same area. See this by adding some additional lines to the right half of that diagram – a vertical line down its middle, a horizontal line across its middle, and finish the diagonal that starts in the upper right and ends in the lower left – this produces eight idential right triangles.",

You can present them with minimal lines, no lines, or with extra lines. Using extra lines provides practice with identifying equivalent fractions. For example, in the first diagram (using all modes), the blue section can be seen as 3/8, 6/16, or 12/32.",

He likes to charge $10 for the whole cake, and he wants to know how much he should charge for each piece. The two cutting patterns in each pair are independent puzzles.\n\nOf course, you can also ask what the fraction of the whole thing each piece is. Also, you can assign a size, say 1, to one of the pieces and then come up with values for all the other pieces.",

Describing, analyzing, and grouping objects by their properties is fundamental, and it is where all mathematics starts.\n\n**Everyday Objects** Point them to an object, a group of objects, a picture, or a part of the place where they are, and ask them to describe some of the individual things they see. Although later shape talks will focus on geometric shapes and relationships, for now choose everyday objects and emphasize that there are interesting things to describe and talk about all around them. Make a habit of referring to objects descriptively as you make use of them in the class area.\n\n**Descriptive Words** There is a large list of possible describing words to use and practice. Here are some examples to get your thoughts flowing:\n* color: blue, red, light brown, dark green, blue green\n* texture: rough, smooth, jagged, slick, bumpy, silky, oily\n* size: small, large, medium, huge, tiny, tall, short, wide, narrow\n* quantity: none, one, two, three, some, many, a lot of\n* use: walk on it, opens something\n* hardness: soft, squishy, firm, rock-like\n* temperature: hot, cold, luke warm, boiling, freezing\n\nMany of these descriptive words can be used in a comparative way. For example, small, smaller, smallest.\n\nThe Similarities and Differences routines are also good ways to practice with descriptive words.",

For young children, the repetition makes it a familiar scenario they can jump right into.\n\nThis is a task that lends itself to being used for addition and subtraction of many types of numbers in early mathematics - small whole numbers, larger whole numbers, integers, fractions, mixed numbers, and decimals.\n\nThe two routines use the same set of numbers, it's just that their roles are reversed when traded between the routines. \"I have 3, and I wish I had 5\" asks for the same answer as \"I have 5, and I only need 3\" – however, the models used to solve these two problems will feel very different.",

This also encourages them to see that the difference of 1/2 and 1 is 1/2.\n\nOn the other hand, if you say you have 1/2 and you need 1, and you follow that up with the question of what do you need to add to 1/2 to get 1, then your students will see that this can be thought of as an unknown addition problem with one unknown – 1/2 + ☐ = 1.\n\nSimilarly, \"I have ☐, and I only need ☐\" can be presented as a difference problem, an addition problem, or a subtraction problem.",

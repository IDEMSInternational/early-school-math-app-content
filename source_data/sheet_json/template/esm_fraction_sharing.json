For these, think of something from their lives (cookies, cake, bread, paint) that can be split evenly among several people.\n\nEncourage your students to try estimates and then adjust as needed. For example, suppose 5 cookies need to be split among 4 people. If they estimate 1 1/2, have them find out that 4 x 1 1/2 is 6, so they need a smaller answer. 1 is clearly too small, so the answer is between 1 and 1 1/2.\n\nExplore the practical side of this. If you split 3 cookies 4 ways, three people can get one piece that is 3/4 of a cookie and the fourth can get three pieces that are 1/4 of a cookie. Or, each of the 4 people can get 1/2 a cookie and 1/4 of a cookie. Which method would your students prefer? Lots' of fun discussions develop this way. When is it possible to give each person the same set of pieces? - Can this always be done reasonably?\n\nNote that some problems can reasonably and productively be thought of two ways. For example, 3 cookies split among 4 people can be thought of as 3/4 for each (with the difficulty noted before). Or, you can simply break all of the cookies into 1/4's and give each person 3.",

Be flexible accepting strategies your students propose and gravitate toward. Present a sequence of expressions or equations that encourage students to practice some general type of calculation. For example, problems might involve compensation ideas and fact families.\n\n**One at a Time:** After introducing the task, give students the first problem and engage in a conversation about how they solved it, highlighting efficient strategies and how the strategies work. Record these ideas on the board. The teacher then poses another problem in the sequence and repeats the process, usually offering three to five problems in a session. At the end of the activity, the teacher synthesizes the methods students found helpful and the mathematical goal of the lesson.",

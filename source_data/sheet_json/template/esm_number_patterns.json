Those growing patterns can be used for these number patterns, but there is also a lot more freedom here to use other patterns.\n\nTeachers often use short sequences of numbers for patterns. Doing this invites perfectly reasonable answers from your students that are not the ones you were looking for. This is fine and it may lead to some rich discussions, just be prepared to be accepting of many viewpoints.\n\n**Example:** What are the next numbers in the sequence 2, 4, 8?\n* 16, 32 – The student is seeing a doubling pattern.\n* 10, 14 – The student is seeing the pattern which alternates adding 2 and adding 4.\n* 14, 22 – The student is seeing a pattern of increasing differences – add 2, add 4, add 6, add 8.",

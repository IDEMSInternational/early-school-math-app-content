Children can get used to seeing 2 + 3 = 5 as meaning that the equal sign is a cue that 2 + 3 is producing 5. This misconception is reinforced by practices such as writing \"2 + 3 = ?\" Make a habit of writing ? = 2 + 3 as often as you write it the other way.\n* Overcome the misconception that one side of the equal sign should have a single number. Overcome this misconception by writing examples such as 2 + 5 = 2 + 2 + 3.\n* Understand that mathematical statements can be false sometimes, that one should not assume that written statements are always true. Make intentional \"mistakes\" such as writing \"2 + 6 = 3 + 4.\" When your students say this is false, ask them for their ideas on how to fix it.",

They show that expressions can be on both sides. They also can be used to illustrate properties – in this case, that the order of addition is not important.\n* **3 + 2 = 7 – 2** This has an expression on both sides and different operations.\n* **3 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1** This helps illustrate that the expressions on either or both sides can be as complicated as you like.",

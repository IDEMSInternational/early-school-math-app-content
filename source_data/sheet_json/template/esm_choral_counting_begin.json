It allows them to practice predicting and reasoning about which number should come next. Ask them \"What comes next?\" and \"Why do you think that is true?\"\n\nSkip counting is valuable for developing many skills.\n* Counting On – Count forward by 1s starting anywhere. This helps with beginning addition.\n* Counting Down by 1s – Helps with understanding the number order more deeply, and it also helps with beginning subtraction.\n* Skip Counting up or down – Helps with mental addition and subtraction. It also helps with multiplication and division.\n\n**Many Types of Numbers** While you will certainly start by counting and skip counting by whole numbers, choral counting is also a very effective routine for practicing with fractions, mixed numbers, or decimal numbers. Doing the skip counting and looking for patterns will give good practice and deeper understandings in all these areas.",

      "value": "**Beginning Modes** There are quite a few modes that choral counting can be done in. Use this progression as your students gain confidence.\n* Use a Number Path / Number Line or 100 Number Chart as a nearby visual reference.\n* Use a Group of Objects\n* Count the Students - Line up the students in 1s, 2s, or whatever the skip count is. Count them as they walk through a doorway or any special place. Have a few walk through first and start with that number, if you don't want to start at 0.\n\n**Count Aloud and Write the Numbers** This is the mode that you will use the most and for a long time. This will involve several parts\n* As the numbers are spoken, write the numbers in an organized fashion. Plan this visual organization in advance as it will greatly influence what your students notice. Decide whether to write the numbers in rows or columns, and how long to make the rows and columns.\n* Pause and review in the middle as needed. Give all students time to understand and contribute to the counting. Have them work with partners to help them get past tricky spots.\n* Use a large enough range of numbers so students can spot patterns. The patterns may emerge down columns, across rows, or even along diagonals.\n* Pause for student ideas during and at the end of the counting. Encourage novel ideas. As ideas are shared, illustrate them in the list of numbers on the board. Lead the discussion so students explain and justify their ideas to the other students. Normalize a healthy discussion of all ideas that is respectful of the possibilities for each idea.\n\n**Estimates** When counting a group of objects, sometimes ask the students to estimate how many there are and write that estimate on the board. Line up the objects in 2s, 3s, or whatever you like to practice skip counting by that many.\n\n**Varied Start Points and Directions** Don't always start or end at 1 or 0. Also, when skip counting, don't always start at a multiple of the skip amount. Otherwise, you will always just count multiples of the skip amount and say the same number sequence every time. Also, counting down is just as important as up, so please give it nearly equal time.\n\n**Count in Groups** When counting objects, sometimes count a set of them and put that group in a special pile to start with. For example, if you are counting 15 pebbles by 2s, sometimes start by counting out 5 of them and put them in a pile. Then count the remaining ones by starting at 5 – \"5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15.\"",

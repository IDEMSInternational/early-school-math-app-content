At the moment there are five kinds of animals and a total of 20 animals. Use different numbers. Add restrictions, such as every enclosure has to have at least 2 animals or no enclosure can have a multiple of 5 animals.\n*There are birds on a wire. They are in groups of 2, 4, 7, 3, 6, and 5. How many are there altogether? What are some ways to do this? Are some easier than others.",

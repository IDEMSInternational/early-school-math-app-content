While it is tempting to focus your attention on Strategies, they are useless in the absence of good Attitudes and Self Monitoring.\n\nOnce all three aspects are in place, the last step to understand is the Process of Problem Solving. Much of this, such as the self monitoring, is a bit sophisticated for a young child. However, you should be aware of all four parts so you can introduce them to your students as they become ready for them.",

Mistakes and failures are an important part of the process. Highlight your own mistakes when they occur.\n* Students should respectuflly challenge the ideas of others (and gracefully accept those challenges), and listen to and build on the ideas of others.\n* Having a partial solution is useful.\n* Persistence and grit are powerful attributes. Putting a problem aside and coming back to it later can lead to fresh insights.\n* Everyone can see themselves as a math person.\n* The current puzzle can be a stepping stone in an exciting journey in related puzzles the students discover and explore.\n\nYou will be fighting against a very large collection of negative misconceptions:\n* People are either born with math talent or they are not.\n* I am a weak math student, so my ideas are generally useless.\n* Math work is lonely.\n* I will never use this math in my real life.\n* Only geniuses are capable of discovering or creating mathematics. \n* If I can't solve a problem in 2 minutes, it must require an expert.\n* Immediately after reading a problem statement, I should understand what is asked.\n* Attaining the answer is the most important aspect of problem solving.\n* Accept procedures at face value and don't try to understand why they work.\n* The math I learn in school is mostly facts and procedures that have to be memorized.\n* It's okay to use math that you do not understand as long as you know how to use it.\n* There is always a rule to follow in solving math problems.\n* Math problems have one and only one right answer, and only one way to get it.",

One example is often not enough to see the mechanisms at play in a puzzle. It’s too easy to get distracted by unimportant details in that particular situation. By looking at many examples, patterns emerge and common characteristics that are crucial start to stand out.\n\n**Do many examples and look for patterns:** Describe Bridges of Königsberg problem and using diagrams.\n\n**Do simipler versions of the problem and look for patterns:** There are many versions of the game of Nim. Suppose you have ten things and you and your opponent are allowed to remove 1 or 2 things from the pile on each turn. The player who removes the last piece wins. Is it better to go first or second, and what is your strategy?\n\nTen is too big a number for seeing the strategy, so let’s reduce it to create simpler versions of the problem. When I asked my high school seniors to do this, they would choose numbers like 3 or 5. If it provides information, always start with the simplest version (1 in this case) and work your way up. Write down what happens if it’s your turn and there are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 things in a pile. In a few seconds  the pattern emerges and you have conquered this game.\n\n**Add or remove elements in the original problem:**",

Look for a good way to present the information of the problem (e.g. tables, drawing).\n2. **Search for and pursue strategies.** This is where most of the time will be spent.\n- a. Analyze the problem looking for entry points and strategies. Make a list (at least mentally) of your strategies and rank them by probable usefulness.\n- b. Pick your top ranked strategy and pursue it. Monitor the time you spend on it and whether pursuing it continues to make sense. When it stops making sense, go on to step c.\n- c. Select a new strategy. Do this either by choosing the next strategy on your list, or by going back to step (1) and check for things you may have misunderstood or missed.\n3. **Review your solution.** Check that your solution is correct and that it makes sense in the world of the problem (for example, deciding that you need 2 2/3 cars would not make sense). Write out all the steps in your solution as clearly as you can. Compare it to other problems you have worked on.

While it is tempting to focus your attention on Strategies, they are useless in the absence of good Attitudes and Self Monitoring.\n\nOnce the first three aspects are in place, the last aspect to understand is the Process of Problem Solving. Much of this, such as the self monitoring, is a bit sophisticated for a young child. However, you should be aware of all four parts so you can introduce them to your students as they become ready for them.",

Mistakes and failures are an important part of the process. Highlight your own mistakes when they occur.\n* Students should respectuflly challenge the ideas of others (and gracefully accept those challenges), and listen to and build on the ideas of others.\n* Having a partial solution is useful.\n* Persistence and grit are powerful attributes. Putting a problem aside and coming back to it later can lead to fresh insights.\n* Everyone can see themselves as a math person.\n* The current puzzle can be a stepping stone in an exciting journey in related puzzles the students discover and explore.\n\nYou will be fighting against a very large collection of negative misconceptions:\n* People are either born with math talent or they are not.\n* I am a weak math student, so my ideas are generally useless.\n* Math work is lonely.\n* I will never use this math in my real life.\n* Only geniuses are capable of discovering or creating mathematics. \n* If I can't solve a problem in 2 minutes, it must require an expert.\n* Immediately after reading a problem statement, I should understand what is asked.\n* Attaining the answer is the most important aspect of problem solving.\n* Accept procedures at face value and don't try to understand why they work.\n* The math I learn in school is mostly facts and procedures that have to be memorized.\n* It's okay to use math that you do not understand as long as you know how to use it.\n* There is always a rule to follow in solving math problems.\n* Math problems have one and only one right answer, and only one way to get it.",

What will you do with the outcome of this work when you obtain it?\n\nHere are some questions a problem solver should ask themselves on a regular basis:\n* Should I pursue this line of thought further, or should I put it aside for now and consider an alternative approach?\n* Should I take this opportunity to create a list of possible next steps by applying some problem-solving strategies?\n* How do I rank the possible next steps I have generated? Generally speaking, quicker steps would rank higher because they can be dispensed with quickly. Complex calculations should generally be avoided unless no simpler options are available.

How many of each animal are there?\n\nIf there were 200 cows, there would be 800 legs, and if there were 200 chickens, there would be 400 legs. Let’s guess 100 of each animal. That would give 600 legs. To get more legs, we need more cows. Let’s guess 150 cows – this gives 700 legs. Reduce the cows to 140 and you get exactly 680 legs. \n\nThe thoughtful person using Guess and Check here would notice that the number of legs increases by twice as much as the increase in the number of cows, and would then use that information to improve future trial numbers. If you are watching and thinking as you do Guess and Check, it has many of the strengths of using the lots of examples strategy.",

Look for similar problems you've seen in the past. Look for a good way to present the information of the problem (e.g. tables, drawing).\n2. **Search for and pursue strategies.** This is where most of the time will be spent.\n- a. Analyze the problem looking for entry points and strategies. Make a list (at least mentally) of your strategies and rank them by probable usefulness.\n- b. Pick your top ranked strategy and pursue it. Monitor the time you spend on it and whether pursuing it continues to make sense. When it stops making sense, go on to step c.\n- c. Select a new strategy. Do this either by choosing the next strategy on your list, or by going back to step (1) and check for things you may have misunderstood or missed.\n3. **Review your solution.** Check that your solution is correct and that it makes sense in the world of the problem (for example, deciding that you need 2 2/3 cars would not make sense). Write out all the steps in your solution as clearly as you can. Compare it to other problems you have worked on. Look for new directions you can take the ideas of this problem to explore more math puzzles.",

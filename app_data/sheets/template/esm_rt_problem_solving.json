It is important that you lay the foundation for good lifelong attitudes and habits for your students towards problem solving and math.\n\nThere are three aspects of problem solving to pay attention to. While it is tempting to focus all your attention on strategies, the strategies are useless in the absence of good attitudes and self monitoring.\n\nOnce all three aspects are in place, the last step to understand is the Process of Problem Solving. Much of this, such as the self-monitoring, is a bit sophisticated for a young child. The point here is for you to be aware of all these parts of problem solving and let you introduce them to your students as they become ready for them.",

As an example, Carol Dweck's work on growth mindset illustrates how significantly a personâ€™s mindset can affect their performance.\n\nOne of your most important tasks as a math teacher is to create a classroom culture that promotes good attitudes in your students. Creating this culture will not happen overnight and it requires patience and persistence on your part.\n\nHere are a list of positive attitudes to promote and nuture:\n* Math is fun, playful, and social.\n* Math can require effort, be challenging, and still be fun and fulfilling.\n* Mistakes and failures are an important part of the process, everyone makes them, and they are good things. Point out your own mistakes when they occur.\n* Encourage students to respectuflly challenge the ideas of others (and learn how to gracefully accept those challenges), and earn how to listen to and build on the good ideas of others.\n* It's good to take appropriate risks - it is often how progress is made.\n* Having a partial solution may be an important step to help a group move forward. Having \"only\" a partial solution is not a failure.\n* Persistence and grit are powerful attributes. Putting a problem aside and coming back to it after a break can lead to fresh insights.\n* A group working together cooperatively can make amazing progress and have a lot of fun.\n* Everyone can see themselves as a math person.\n* The current puzzle can be a stepping stone to an exciting journey in related puzzles the students discover and solve.\n\nYou will be fighting against a very large collection of negative misconceptions:\n* People are either born with math talent or they are not.\n* I am a weak math student, so my ideas are generally useless.\n* Math work is lonely and is performed by an isolated individual.\n* Weak students attribute their math successes to luck and their failures to lack of ability.\n* I will never use this math in my real life.\n* Formal mathematics has little to do with real thinking.\n* Only geniuses are capable of discovering or creating mathematics. If you forget something, don't try to recreate it. Accept procedures at face value and don't try to understand why they work.\n* If I can't solve a problem in 2 minutes, it must require an expert.\n* Immediately after reading a problem statement, I should understand what is asked.\n* Each step must be accurate without trial and error experiments.\n* Attaining the answer is the most important aspect of problem solving.\n* Problem solving is a linear process towards a solution.\n* A proposition is true if it sounds true or rings true.\n* When I do a proof, I can only verify something a mathematician has shown to be true.\n* The math I learn in school is mostly facts and procedures that have to be memorized.\n* It's okay to use math that you do not understand as long as you know how to use it.\n* Learning mathematics is mostly memorizing.\n* There is always a rule to follow in solving math problems.\n* Math problems have one and only one right answer. There is only one correct way to solve any math problem (usually the method most recently deomonstrated by the teacher).",

What will you do with the outcome when you obtain it?\n\nHere are some questions a problem solver should ask themselves on a regular basis:\n* Should I pursue this line of thought further, or should I back off and put it aside for now and consider an alternative approach?\n* Should I take this opportunity to create a list of possible next steps by applying some problem-solving strategies that appear to apply to this situation?\n* How do I rank the possible next steps I have generated? Generally speaking, quicker steps would rank higher because they can be dispensed with quickly. Complex calculations should generally be avoided unless no simpler options are available. However; a particularly promising long calculation might be preferred if confidence in it is high.\n* Is it time to take a break and let my thoughts regroup in the background?",

However, among those are a few general strategies that will serve you and your students well in a great many circumstances.\n\n1. **Learn from simpler versions of the problem.** This might include breaking off a portion of the problem to solve first. Add or remove elements to the original problem description. Look for patterns.\n2. **Learn from doing examples.** Perhaps lots of them. Look for patterns.\n\nThese first two are strongly related and sometimes difficult to think of as separate strategies. When employing either strategy, it is essential that the data related to those experiences is kept in an organized way that makes it easier to spot patterns.\n\n3. **Represent the problem in an easier to relate to way.** This may involve acting it out, or perhaps making a diagram or a model. Or it may involve making a table or list of the information organized in an easier to understand fashion.\n\n4. **Use educated guess-and-check.** This method gets a bad reputation because people assume incorrectly that no thinking is going on. Finding good guesses to try out, analyzing the results from those guesses, and then revising the guesses to make new ones, is an important problem solving technique that often yields great results. It overlaps with strategy (2).\n\n5. **Identify a related problem you already know how to solve.**\n\n6. **Work forward from the givens and work backward from the goals.** With luck these will meet in the middle.",

Analyze the problem looking for entry points and strategies. Make a list (at least mentally) of your strategies and rank them by probable usefulness.\n- b. Pick your top ranked strategy and pursue it. As you do, monitor the time you spend on it and whether pursuing it continues to make sense. When it stops making sense, go on to step c.\n- c.

Counting on, skip counting, counting down, estimate and then count\n* Target number - have a number of the day. See how many ways the number can be created. Add restrictions to the ways allowed to guide the practice.\n* Equality concept - find ways to create the same value on two sides of an equal sign\n* Number Line - put a collection of numbers on a number line or number path\n* \"I have ... I wish I had\" - how many more do you need? Counting on, counting down\n* Shape talks - talks involving shape properties\n* Fluency practice\n* Which One Doesn't Belong or Who is the Spy or Each of these things is different from the others\n* Short math games - Nim 1-2, I'm Thinking of a Number",

This can be played for fun for a long time without any strategic thinking. Suppose a student gets interested in learning how to win. Suppose you challenge them to beat you. Now they have a puzzle to solve! What can they do? Let them work in groups to hypothesize winning strategies. \n\nAt this point you can either remind them or teach them about the problem solving strategy of learning from examples and doing simpler versions of a puzzle. What would be simpler versions? As much as possible, have them come up with what simpler versions would look like and have them do the record. keeping. A winning strategy should emerge.",

          "value": "Math games that involve no choices may give fun ways for students to practice math skills, but their lack of problem solving and strategies exclude them from being rich tasks. The various versions of the card game War are good examples of this.\n\nGames that have an element of chance are great levelers. Without chance, poorer players may get overly discouraged and lose interest in playing.\n\nGames that have choices invite the student to problem solve to figure out ways to win. Developing strategies for playing a game against an imaginary opponent means creating your own puzzle and attempting to solve it. Problem solving strategies can then be discussed and practiced.\n\n**Nim 1-2** is a great example. Suppose your class is playing the version that starts at 10 and a player wins if they get to 0. This can be played for fun for a long time without any strategic thinking. Suppose a student gets interested in learning how to win. Suppose you challenge them to beat you. Now they have a puzzle to solve! What can they do? Let them work in groups to hypothesize winning strategies. \n\nAt this point you can either remind them or teach them about the problem solving strategy of learning from examples and doing simpler versions of a puzzle. What would be simpler versions? As much as possible, have them come up with what simpler versions would look like and have them do the record. keeping. A winning strategy should emerge.",

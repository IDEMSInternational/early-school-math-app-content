I'm leaving this out of the Routines for now.\n\n\nThese activities provide practice with analyzing properties of objects.\n\n**Similar and Different** – Two items are given and the students are challenged to find ways in which the items are similar and ways in which they are different. A similar activity is to pick one item and ask the students to find other items that are similar to it (and why) or different from it (and why). Here are a few examples:\n\n* Picture of Fork and Spoon\n* Picture of Square and Non-Square Rectangle\n* Bird and 4-legged animal\n* Fish and \n\n**Which One Doesn't Belong** (also called \"Who Is the Spy?\") – These two activities are very similar. Four items are given. The challenge is to find a property shared by three of the items but not shared by the fourth. In the Spy version, for each item make a list of ways that the item fits into the crowd and ways that it doesn't. The Spy is the one that has the most differences.\n\nThis is often played with four pictures of objects. \n\n* tree, bird, fish, rock\n\nHowever, it can also be played with a set of four numbers. Here are some examples of groups of four numbers.\n\n* 2, 4, 5, 8 – 5 is the only odd number.\n* 3, 0, 2, 10 – 0 is the only non-positive number, 3 is the only odd number, 10, is the only 2-digit number – sometimes there is more than one answer!\n\n**Each of These is Not Like the Others** – This is similar to Which One Doesn't Belong. The difference is now your students are challenged to find properties that cause each of the four items not to belong.",

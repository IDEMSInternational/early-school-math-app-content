These can be propped up on a table or ledge, or they can be paper clipped on a string. Having an individual card for each number allows for more natural association with number cards you may be using for demonstration purposes, and it also allows them to be moved around or left out (for activities like \"put these in order\" or \"which one is missing.\"\n* A line with numbered tick marks, which is the traditional number line, but it is a little bit more abstract than the first option.\n* A path of numbers on the ground, which is called a number path.\n\n< put in illustrations for each of the three options >",

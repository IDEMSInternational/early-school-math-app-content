I wish I had\" scenario.\n\nThis will be a collection of images with short text describing the challenge. These should probably be put into the categories of skills being worked on.\n\nTypical guiding questions for the teacher:\n* How many dots can you see?\n* What is the total?\n* How many dots are covered by the Splat? How do you know?\n* Think of other ways to figure that out or confirm it.\n* Let's check to see if that works.\n\nThese first ones can be done in the following steps:\n* Show all the dots and count them together\n* Cover over some of the dots with a Splat\n* Count the number of dots you can see\n* Figure out how dots are covered.\n\nWe could have 3 buttons for each Splat - one that reveals the total count, one that covers and uncovers the Splat, and one that gives the answer for how many things were covered. Will we want people to use it this way, or do we just want to enable them to be able to do this on their own with paper and dots? Will teachers be showing students what's on their phone?\n\n**SIngle Splats With Total Given**\n\nSome dots of one color will show, the rest are covered by a Splat, and a total is prominently displayed.\n\nFor some of these, it may not be determinable what's under a Splat - in which case discuss what the possibilities are.\n\n**Two Splats With Same Color** - Same color must have same count.\n\n**Two Splats With Different Colors** - Different color must have different counts.",

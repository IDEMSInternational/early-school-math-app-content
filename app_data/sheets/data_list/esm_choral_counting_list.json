As you do beginning counting together, point to the numbers on a number path or number line as they are said aloud. Counting objects, even your students, will help them see what the numbers they are saying mean.\n\nStart with basic counting to a small number, such as 5. Slowly extend the range of the numbers and also the type of counting you do. Counting down is just as important as counting up.\n\n**Steps:**\n* **Count up by 1s from 0 and 1** – Keep counting things whenever you reference a count. If you want four books, count them out as you hand them over. Starting at 0 is important for making 0 a real number that has meaning to them.\n* **Count down by 1s to 0 and 1** – Counting down is easy to do whenever you are counting down seconds or counting how many things are left as they are being removed. Counting down is also great to practice when your students are counting between 10 and 100 – they usually have to give a lot more thought to the transitions between decades, such as counting \"72, 71, 70, 69, 68,\" and that thoughtfullness will lead to deeper understandings than just repeatedly counting upward.\n* **Count On by 1s** – Perhaps you have 8 things to count. Count out a few of them and put them in a pile, say 3 of them. Then count the whole group by starting at 3 – \"3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\""

Tell your students it's a faster way to count when they have more than a few things. If they have trouble with this, you can have them say each skipped number very quietly. Encourage them to notice that all the numbers are even if they start at an even number, and they are all odd if they start at an odd number.\n* **Skip Count by 10s** – The connection with place value makes this skip counting particularly important. It also makes it pretty easy. If you write the numbers down, or show them on a 100 Chart, your students will quickly notice that the digit in the ones column stays the same – discuss why that is.\n* **Skip Count by 5s** – This follows naturally from skip counting by 10s. Only two digits will show up in the ones column, and only two columns in the 100 Chart will be visited."

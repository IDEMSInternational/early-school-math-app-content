Have a number path to 10 (or 15 or 20) on a ledge where all the students can see it.\n\n**Random Cards:** In addition to the number path, have a shuffled deck of cards with numbers you want to practice.\n* Hold up a card from the deck directly above the same card on the path. Suppose the number pulled from the deck is 6. Pointing forward to the nearby path numbers say \"What's 1 more than 6?\" After a while, simplify this to \"What's 1 more?\"\n* After the students are comfortable doing the previous step, hold the cards from the deck nearby but not on the humber path, so the students can still see the number path. Ask the same questions.\n* After a while mix in pointing at the card and saying simply \"plus 1\" and have them give you the number.\n\nDo the same thing, one at a time (taking a lot of time to develop each one), with 2 more (or \"plus 2\"), go back 1 (or \"1 less\"), and go back 2 (or \"2 less\").\n\n**Mix Them** Then, start mixing these four calculations. Select a number card from the deck, go to the number on the path, and ask for all four nearby numbers (using the previous phrases). After this is easy, move a little bit away from the number path and continue doing it.\n\n**Taped Card Sequence:** Next, have a sequence of cards that are taped together or otherwise connected. Flip through the numbers and ask for their relationship.\n\nFor example,\n* Suppose the first card is 6. Say \"What are we at?\" and the students say 6.\n* Now keep showing the 6 and show the next card (a 4) - the students say \"2 less.\"\n* Fold back the 6, showing only the 4 and say \"What are we at?\" and the students say 4.\n* Now keep showing the 4 and show the next card (a 5) - the students say \"1 more\".\n* Fold back the 4, showing only the 5 and say \"What are we at?\" and the students say 5.\n* Now keep showing the 5 and show the next card (a 7) - the students say \"2 more.\"\n* And so on."

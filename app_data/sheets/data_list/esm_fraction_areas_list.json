He likes to charge $10 for the whole cake, and he wants to know how much he should charge for each piece. The two cutting patterns in each pair are independent puzzles.\n\nOf course, you can also ask what the fraction of the whole thing each piece is. Also, you can assign a size, say 1, to one of the pieces and then come up with values for all the other pieces."

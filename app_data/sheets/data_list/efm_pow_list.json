The five pairs have the same sum, and when we add them all up we get the same thing as adding the numbers up from 0 to 9.

Also, note that it makes no difference whether we start at 0 or 1, so we’ll just look at starting at 0.\n\n**0 to 7 using 4 pairs:** The sum of the numbers from 0 to 7 is 28.

The answer is: 7 + 7 = 14.\n\n**Exploration:** Here are two, slightly more challenging, letter substitution puzzles to play with.\n\nH + 4 = KK: K must be 1, so the problem becomes H + 4 = 11, which forces H = 7. The answer is: 7 + 4 = 11.\n\nM + M + 8 = MN: As a carry, M could be 1 or 2. However, if M is 2 then 2 + 2 + 8 must be at least 20, which it isn’t. Therefore, M is 1 and the answer becomes 1 + 1 + 8 = 10."

This means that the two numbers on the right side of the upper row are (3 4) when 8 is in the middle, or (2 4) when 9 is in the middle.\n\n**Suppose the central square is 8.** This means the right side of the upper row is (3 4).\n\nLooking at the bottom left 2 by 2 corner, the two squares shared with the bottom right 2 by 2 corner are (8 6) or (8 9). However, (8 9) makes it impossible to get a sum of 23 in the bottom left 2 by 2 corner. Therefore, it must be (8 6), and so the bottom left corner must be 2.\n\nThe only unused value is 1, which must go in the upper left corner. That makes the sum of the upper left corner either 1 + 3 + 7 + 8 = 19 or 1 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 20. The latter of the two is a solution!\n\n**Suppose the central square is 9.** This means the right side of the upper row is (2 4).\n\nLooking at the bottom left 2 by 2 corner, the two squares shared with the bottom right 2 by 2 corner are (9 6) or (9 8). However, (9 8) makes it impossible to get a sum of 23 in the bottom left 2 by 2 corner. Therefore, it must be (8 6), and so the bottom left corner must be 1.\n\nThe only unused value is 3, which must go in the upper left corner. That makes the sum of the upper left corner either 3 + 2 + 7 + 9 = 21 or 3 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 23, neither of which work!\n\nTherefore, the only solution is given by (showing triplets as rows):\n\n(1 4 3)\n(7 8 5)\n(2 6 9)"

You can produce all squares of this size in the grid by shifting this starter square around. You have the choice of moving it to the right or down the remaining number of positions.

It is not important for young children to prove these things.\n\n**Result 1:** If a corner has an odd number of streets coming to it, the parade must start or end there. \nThe reason for this is simple. Every time a parade goes into and back out of a corner, that accounts for an even number of streets coming to that corner. Therefore, corners with an odd number of streets must be the start or end of the parade.\n\n**Result 2:** If there are more than two corners with an odd number of streets coming into them, then this map cannot have a parade.\n\n**Result 3:** If there are exactly two corners with an odd number of streets, then any parade must begin at one of them and end at the other. In particular, it is impossible to have a parade that begins and ends at the same place.\n\n**Result 4:** If there are no corners with an odd number of streets, then a parade can start anywhere, and it must start and end at the same place."

Some parades can start and end anywhere, and some must start or end at very specific locations.\n\nAfter looking at lots of examples, the following observation emerges. It is not important for young children to prove these things.\n\n**Result 1:** If a corner has an odd number of streets coming to it, the parade must start or end there. \nThe reason for this is simple. Every time a parade goes into and back out of a corner, that accounts for an even number of streets coming to that corner. Therefore, corners with an odd number of streets must be the start or end of the parade.\n\n**Result 2:** If there are more than two corners with an odd number of streets coming into them, then this map cannot have a parade.\n\n**Result 3:** If there are exactly two corners with an odd number of streets, then any parade must begin at one of them and end at the other. In particular, it is impossible to have a parade that begins and ends at the same place.\n\n**Result 4:** If there are no corners with an odd number of streets, then a parade can start anywhere, and it must start and end at the same place."

Because a domino has an even number of squares, every time a domino is put on a board, the number of available squares is reduced by an even number. Therefore, if there were an even number of squares available before the domino, it will still be even after the domino, and if there were an odd number of squares before the domino, it will still be odd.\n\nFor the introductory examples at the top of the first page, the first example has an even number of squares, so it is numerically possible to end with 0 squares (which is an even number). The second example starts with an odd number of squares, so it is impossible for it to be covered with dominoes.\n\nThe second formula is to take the difference between the number of dark squares and the number of light ones. When a domino is put on the board, it covers a dark square and a light square, so the difference of those counts stays the same. For example, the difference is 8 - 6 = 2 before any dominoes are placed (looking at the first challenge board), and it will be 7 - 5 = 2 after placing a domino. A formula such as this, that does not change during moves in a game or puzzle, is called an invariant.\n\nBecause the difference starts at 8 - 6 = 2 for the first challenge board, it can never be completely covered by dominoes (which would bring the difference to 0 - 0 = 0).\n\nThe second board starts with a difference 7 - 7 = 0, so there is a chance that it can be covered. It is actually quite easy to cover the second board with dominoes.\n\n**Exploration:** Calculating the difference of dark and white squares tells you a lot about which boards can be done. The only difference that gives a chance for success is a difference of 0. If you were to remove four squares, it is possible to have a difference of 0 and not be able to cover the remaining squares - this happens when one of the corner squares gets isolated.

The second challenge board has complete paths that work from each of the white squares and none of the dark squares.\n\nThat’s an interesting result.\n\nThe question you want your students to ask at this point is: Why do we see this pattern of results?\n\nLooking at the example paths in the introduction, an important observation is that the color of the squares will alternate along any path. This is because two squares that share a side will be of opposite colors. If you think of a complete path as an alternating list of all the squares of a board, this will be the key to seeing when it is impossible to have a complete path.\n\nFor example, look at the 3 by 5 grid in the introduction and in the challenge. It has 8 white squares and 7 black squares. A path that starts at a white square can alternate colors and work: WBWBWBWBWBWBWBW. However, a path that starts at a black square will be stuck: BWBWBWBWBWBWBW without any way of reaching the eighth W square.\n\nFor rectangular boards that have an even number of squares and hence the same number of white and black squares, a complete path can start anywhere.

The second challenge board has complete paths that work from each of the white squares and none of the dark squares.\n\nThat’s an interesting result.\n\nThe question you want your students to ask at this point is: Why do we see this pattern of results?\n\nLooking at the example paths in the introduction, an important observation is that the color of the squares will alternate along any path. This is because two squares that share a side will be of opposite colors. If you think of a complete path as an alternating list of all the squares of a board, this will be the key to seeing when it is impossible to have a complete path.\n\nFor example, look at the 3 by 5 grid in the introduction and in the challenge. It has 8 white squares and 7 black squares. A path that starts at a white square can alternate colors and work: WBWBWBWBWBWBWBW. However, a path that starts at a black square will be stuck: BWBWBWBWBWBWBW without any way of reaching the eighth W square.\n\nFor rectangular boards that have an even number of squares and hence the same number of white and black squares, a complete path can start anywhere. For rectangular boards that have an odd number of squares, complete paths must start in the corners or from squares that are the same color as the corners."

The advantage of using this form of the puzzle is that no negative numbers will be involved.\n\nA few easy notes to start with. All differences are nonnegative, so the final answer can never be less than 0. The numbers that get created from differences are either with the original numbers or from numbers derived from those numbers. So the maximum number that can be used with a difference is the largest number, which is 5. We want to know which of the numbers from 0 to 5 are possible final answers.\n\nLook at this as an evens and odds problem. Start by counting the number of odd numbers. In the case of going from 1 to 5, that count is 3, which is itself an odd number. So, we have an odd number of odd numbers. Make a list of what happens when you take a difference: 1) If both numbers are even, the result is an even number and there is no change in the total number of odd numbers; 2) if one number is odd and the other is even, the result is an odd number and there is no change in the total number of odd numbers; and 3) if both numbers are odd numbers, then the result is an even number and the total number of odd numbers is reduced by two. In all cases, the total number of odd numbers either stays the same or is reduced by two. \n\n**Result:** If we start with an odd number of odd numbers, we will end with an odd number (1) of them. If we start with an even number of odd numbers, then we will end with an even number (0) of them.\n\nIn the case of going from 1 to 5, we started with an odd number of odd numbers, so the final answer must be odd. The final answer must be 1,3 or 5. Some quick experimenting shows that they are all possible.\n\nThe analysis is exactly the same for the numbers from 1 to 6 because there are still three odd numbers.\n\nFor the range 1 to 7, there are now an even number of odd numbers, so there will be zero odd numbers at the end and the  possible last numbers are 0, 2, 4, or 6 (which can all occur).\n\n**Exploration:** It is easy to see when 0 is possible. Start by pairing up consecutive numbers from the top and taking their differences. This gives a collection of 1’s. If there are an even number of 1’s, then you can get a 0, and if there are an odd number, you can get a 1. Not surprisingly, this is the same as finding out whether you started with an even or odd number of odd numbers. Take 1 to 7 as an example: (7 6) (5 4) (3 2) 1 => 1 1 1 1 => (1 1) (1 1) => 0 0 => 0.\n\nYou can do the same thing to see if the top number is possible. Pair up consecutive numbers starting at the top leaving out the top number. Take the differences of these pairs. You now have a list of 1’s together with the top number. Reduce the list of 1’s to either a single 0 or single 1. Take the difference of that with the top number!"

      "block2_text": "THE CHALLENGE: This puzzle is a wonderful example of using two related problem-solving techniques - learning from examples and learning from simpler versions of the problem.\n\nLet’s work our way up to three pirates.\n\n* 1 Pirate: This is easy. The youngest pirate gets all 12 gold coins.\n* 2 Pirates: The youngest pirate gets nothing. If the youngest pirate tried to have any of the gold, the other pirate would vote against the plan, forcing the youngest to leave and thereby getting everything anyway.\n* 3 Pirates: The youngest pirate need only convince one other pirate to vote for the plan. As we saw in the two-pirate case, the second-youngest pirate will get nothing if the initial plan is rejected. So, the youngest pirate’s plan just needs to give the second-youngest pirate 1 gold coin to give the second-youngest pirate a reason to vote for the plan.\n\nGiving away 1 gold coin means the youngest pirate gets to keep 11 gold coins!\n\nIn “Pirates with Gold - 2” we will see what happens when there even more pirates."

The digits count the digits of each type, so the sum of the digits counts all the digits.\n\n**Result 2:** The sum of the products is the number of digits. Put another way, if you take the sum of multiplying each digit by the size of the digits it is counting, that sum must be the number of digits. This result follows from Result 1 because the sum of the products counts up all the digits involved in the number.\n\nLook at the two given examples. In 1210, the sum of the products is (1 x 0) + (2 x 1) + (1 x 2) + (0 x 3) = 4. In 2020, the sum is (2 x 0) + (0 x 1) + (2 x 2) + (0 x 3) = 4.\n\n**Result 3:** The rightmost, low-order digit, the ones digit, is 0. From Result 2, this digit must be 0 or 1 (or the product would be too large). Suppose it is 1. To avoid using variables, let’s suppose we have a 6-digit number. Then the ones place counts the number of 5’s. If there is a 5 someplace, then, by result 1, the only other non-zero digit must be a 1. But then we would have four 0’s, which is impossible.\n\n**Result 4:** The high-order digit is not 0. This must be true for this number to be considered a number.\nOkay, let’s construct some answers for 5-digit numbers.\n\nThere is a basic tension between results 1 and 2. To keep those sums the same, there must be an increase in 0’s. For example, for each 2 there must be an extra 0, for each 3 there must be two extra 0’s, for each 4 there must be three extra 0’s, and so on. That’s why most self-describing numbers have a lot of 0’s.\n\nIf the number of 0’s were 1, there would need to be nonzero numbers in every place except the far right place. But having all those nonzero numbers would necessitate having more 0’s to make Result 2 work out. So, having only one zero in numbers with more than four digits is impossible. We can call that Result 5 if you like.\n\nIf there are 2 0’s, the number is either 22100 or 21200. Of those, only 21200 works, and that is the answer!\n\nIf there are 3 0’s, the number would be 32000, which doesn’t work.\n\n**Exploration:** Let’s look at the cases individually. Remember the four results when looking at these.\n\n**1 digit:** Results 3 and 4 make this impossible.\n\n**2 digit:** The number would have to be 20,  which is not self describing.\n\n**3 digit:** The number would have to be either 300, 210, or 120. None of these is self describing."

So, there is at least one 1. That gives us three nonzero entries. It is now impossible to have a single 1 (how would we fill in the number of 1’s), so the number of 1’s must be at least two.

          "eng": "**The Challenge:** A useful thing to notice is that it does not matter how we pair up the numbers in the ones column with the numbers in the tens column, so that is one less thing to think about.\n\nTo get close to 100, we want the tens column to add up to 8, 9, or 10. Because the sum of the numbers from 1 to 6 is 21, we can subtract the sum of the tens column from 21 to see what the sum of the ones column will be. In all there can be only three possible sums to consider: \n\n* The tens column sums to 8 and the ones column sums to 13, which gives an overall sum of 93.\n* The tens column sums to 9 and the ones column sums to 12, which gives an overall sum of 102.\n* The tens column sums to 10 and the ones column sums to 11, which gives an overall sum of 111.\n\nOf these 102 is the best. Any combination of digits in the tens column that sums to 9 will give the best possible answer. The things that work are 1 + 2 + 6, 1 + 3 + 5, and 2 + 3 + 4.\n\nHere are some typical answers all of which sum to 102: 13 + 24 + 65, 16 + 34 + 52, and 21 + 35 + 46.\n\n**Exploration:** The analysis for the numbers from 1 to 7 is nearly the same as before. We still want the tens column to add up to 8, 9, or 10. The sum of the remaining digits will have some variability thanks to the wider range.\n\n* The tens column sums to 8. The largest that 3 of the remaining 4 numbers can sum to is 17 (4 + 6 + 7), with overall sum 97.\n* The tens column sums to 9. The smallest that 3 of the remaining 4 numbers can sum to is 12, with overall sum 102. The same answer as using the numbers from 1 to 6. The 7 is of no use here.\n* The tens column sums to 10. We don’t need to look at this as it will be too large.\n\nTo look at 1 to 8, we only need to look at the tens column adding up to 8 or 9. As before, if the tens column sums to 9, the best we can do will be 102. The question is, can we do better when the tens column sum is 8? If we use 1 + 3 + 4 in the tens column, then we can use 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 in the ones column. We can hit 100 exactly!\n\nSo, one best answer for 1 to 8 is 15 + 37 + 48 = 100. There are plenty more that you can create by moving around the ones column numbers."

      "block4_text": "**The Challenge:** A useful thing to notice is that it does not matter how we pair up the numbers in the ones column with the numbers in the tens column, so that is one less thing to think about.\n\nTo get close to 100, we want the tens column to add up to 8, 9, or 10. Because the sum of the numbers from 1 to 6 is 21, we can subtract the sum of the tens column from 21 to see what the sum of the ones column will be. In all there can be only three possible sums to consider: \n\n* The tens column sums to 8 and the ones column sums to 13, which gives an overall sum of 93.\n* The tens column sums to 9 and the ones column sums to 12, which gives an overall sum of 102.\n* The tens column sums to 10 and the ones column sums to 11, which gives an overall sum of 111.\n\nOf these 102 is the best. Any combination of digits in the tens column that sums to 9 will give the best possible answer. The things that work are 1 + 2 + 6, 1 + 3 + 5, and 2 + 3 + 4.\n\nHere are some typical answers all of which sum to 102: 13 + 24 + 65, 16 + 34 + 52, and 21 + 35 + 46.\n\n**Exploration:** The analysis for the numbers from 1 to 7 is nearly the same as before. We still want the tens column to add up to 8, 9, or 10. The sum of the remaining digits will have some variability thanks to the wider range.\n\n* The tens column sums to 8. The largest that 3 of the remaining 4 numbers can sum to is 17 (4 + 6 + 7), with overall sum 97.\n* The tens column sums to 9. The smallest that 3 of the remaining 4 numbers can sum to is 12, with overall sum 102. The same answer as using the numbers from 1 to 6. The 7 is of no use here.\n* The tens column sums to 10. We don’t need to look at this as it will be too large.\n\nTo look at 1 to 8, we only need to look at the tens column adding up to 8 or 9. As before, if the tens column sums to 9, the best we can do will be 102. The question is, can we do better when the tens column sum is 8? If we use 1 + 3 + 4 in the tens column, then we can use 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 in the ones column. We can hit 100 exactly!\n\nSo, one best answer for 1 to 8 is 15 + 37 + 48 = 100. There are plenty more that you can create by moving around the ones column numbers."

          "eng": "**The Challenge:** Let your students play with this. If they pay attention to what they’re doing, they’ll discover interesting relationships and get a lot out of it. For young students, there is absolutely no need to go into any kind of careful analysis. What follows is a more analytical way to find the solutions.\n\n**Common Sum:** The simplest way to start analyzing this puzzle is to find the common sum. Each row adds up to the common sum. Also, the three rows contain the numbers from 0 to 8 and add up to three times the common sum. Therefore, three times the common sum is 36 (the sum of 0 to ), so the common sum is 12.\n\n**Central Square:** The next step is to add up the four lines that go through the center square. The common sum is 12 and there are four lines, so their sum must be 4 x 12 = 48. Alternatively, the four lines contain every number once, plus the central square three more times. The sum of the numbers from 0 to 8 is 36. So, 48 equals 36 plus 3 times the central square. So, the central square must be 4.\n\n**Adding up to 12:** There are surprisingly few ways to add up to 12. They are:\n\n(0 4 8) (1 4 7) (2 4 6) (3 4 5) (0 5 7) (1 3 8) (1 5 6) (2 3 7)\n\nYou can figure out a lot for this list. Look at how often a number appears in a triplet:\n\n* 4 times: 4\n* 3 times: 1, 3, 5, 7\n* 2 times: 0, 2, 6, 8\n\nNext, compare this to how many times a square in the diagram is in one of the lines. You’ll see that the center square is in four lines, the corner squares are in three lines, and the middle of the sides are in two lines. This is another way to see that the center square must be 4. Also, the corners must be 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the middle of the sides must be 0, 2, 6, and 8.\n\n**Fill up the Square:** The hard work is done. Start with 4 in the middle and put 7 in one corner. Note that 0 must go next to the 7 on one side or the other (otherwise the 8 would be forced next to the 7) . You will have no choices after that. One answer, by rows, is: (7 0 5) (2 4 6) (3 8 1). Notice that this is the same as any other answer by rotating the square and possibly flipping it.\n\n**Exploration:** As noted in the last paragraph, all the solutions are essentially the same - rotate the square until the 7’s are in the same corner, and take the mirror image (if needed) along the diagonal to put the 0 in the same position.\n\nSolving this puzzle for 1 to 9 would mean adding 1 to every entry in the 0 to 8 solution. Solving this puzzle for 2 to 18 would mean doubling all the entries for the 1 to 9 solution."

To get the smallest weight of a pair, we must add A and B, so A + B = 22. Similarly for the heaviest, D + E = 33. Consequently, 69 = (A + B) + C + (D + E) = 22 + C + 33 = 55 + C, which forces C = 14.\n\nTo get the second lightest weight of 24, we must add A and C, so 24 = A + C = A + 14, which forces A = 10. Similarly for the second heaviest weight of 32, we must add E and C, so 32 = E + C = E + 14, which forces E = 18.\n\nTo finish this off, A + B = 22 forces B = 12, and D + E = 33 forces D = 15.\n\nSo the weights in order are: 10, 12, 14, 15, and 18.\n\nThese steps will work for any set of five weights."

The packages, weighed in pairs, weigh 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, and 33 pounds. How much does each package weigh?\n\n**Exploration:** Make up a few of these problems for your friends. See if you can come up with a general method for solving this kind of puzzle.",
      "block2_text": "**The Challenge and Exploration:** Each box is weighed four times in the process of weighing all the pairs of boxes. Therefore, if we add up all ten weights, we will find out what four times the total weight of the boxes is. If we divide this number by four, we will have the sum of their weights.\n\nAdding up the weights we get 22 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 + 30 + 32 + 33 = 276. So, the total weight of the boxes is 276 / 4 = 69 pounds.\n\nLet the weights of the boxes in order, from lightest to heaviest, be A, B, C, D, and E. Then A + B + C + D + E = 69. To get the smallest weight of a pair, we must add A and B, so A + B = 22. Similarly for the heaviest, D + E = 33. Consequently, 69 = (A + B) + C + (D + E) = 22 + C + 33 = 55 + C, which forces C = 14.\n\nTo get the second lightest weight of 24, we must add A and C, so 24 = A + C = A + 14, which forces A = 10. Similarly for the second heaviest weight of 32, we must add E and C, so 32 = E + C = E + 14, which forces E = 18.\n\nTo finish this off, A + B = 22 forces B = 12, and D + E = 33 forces D = 15.\n\nSo the weights in order are: 10, 12, 14, 15, and 18.\n\nThese steps will work for any set of five weights."

If 1/N = 1/A - 1/B, then 1/A - 1/N = 1/B > 0. 1/A - 1/N > 0 means that N > A. So, 1 < A < N, which means there are at most N - 2 solutions, and they can be found, somewhat tediously, by checking all the values of A in that range.\n\nFor denominators that are even numbers, say 2d, there is always 1/2d = 1/d - 1/2d.\n\nAnother way to produce differences is to start with an addition formula. The simplest one we have is that 1/n = 1/(n+1) + 1/[n(n+1)]. This becomes 1/(n+1) = 1/n - 1/[n(n+1)]. A more general version of this is 1/ab = 1/[a(a+b)] + 1/[b(a+b)] which becomes 1/[a(a+b)]  = 1/ab - 1/[b(a+b)] where ab > 1.\n\nSo, whenever the denominator can be factored as a(a+b), with a and b positive and ab > 1, we will have a difference. In particular, because every number n > 2 can be written as n = 1 x (1 + (n-1)), then every Egyptian Fraction can be written as a difference in at least one way.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n* 1/3: a = 1, b = 2 gives 1/2 - 1/6\n* 1/4: a = 1, b = 3 gives 1/3 - 1/12\n* 1/5: a = 1, b = 4 gives 1/4 - 1/20\n* 1/6: a = 1, b = 5 gives 1/5 - 1/30; a = 2, b = 1 gives 1/2 - 1/3\n* 1/7: a = 1, b = 6 gives 1/6 - 1/42\n* 1/8: a = 1, b = 7 gives 1/7 - 1/56; a = 2, b = 2 gives 1/4 - 1/8\n\nThis is not everything. For example, we have missed 1/6 = 1/4 - 1/12.\n\nDiving into some algebra, for a > 1 and b > a >1, consider 1/n = 1/a - 1/b = (b - a) / ab. Clearing the denominators produces ab = n(b-a), and solving for n gives, n = ab/(b-a). Whenever we can find a and b that makes this work, we will be able to produce the difference.\n\nLet’s look at the complete solutions for a few examples from this point of view and see if we can spot a pattern.\n\n* 3 = 2 x 6 / (6 - 2)\n* 4 = 2 x 4 / (4 - 2) = 3 x 12 / (12 - 3)\n* 5 = 4 x 20 / (20 - 4)\n* 6 = 2 x 3 / (3 - 2) = 3 x 6 / (6 - 3) = 4 x 12 / (12 - 4) = 5 x 30 / (30 - 5)\n* 7 = 6 x 42 / (42 - 6)\n* 8 = 4 x 8 / (8 - 4) = 6 x 24 / (24 - 6) = 7 x 56 / (56 - 7)\n\nLooking at these examples, it  seems likely that there is only one solution when n is a prime. Let’s see why that is. If n is a prime and a < n, then n = a x b / (b - a) forces b to be a multiple of n, say b = n x c. Then n = a x nc / (nc - a) says that ac / (nc - a) = 1, which means ac = nc - a. Rewriting this we get nc = a(c + 1). Because n is a prime, we have c + 1 = n and a = c = n - 1. So a = n - 1 and b = n(n-1) is the only solution!"

Whenever we can find a and b that makes this work, we will be able to produce the difference.\n\nLet’s look at the complete solutions for a few examples from this point of view and see if we can spot a pattern.\n\n* 3 = 2 x 6 / (6 - 2)\n* 4 = 2 x 4 / (4 - 2) = 3 x 12 / (12 - 3)\n* 5 = 4 x 20 / (20 - 4)\n* 6 = 2 x 3 / (3 - 2) = 3 x 6 / (6 - 3) = 4 x 12 / (12 - 4) = 5 x 30 / (30 - 5)\n* 7 = 6 x 42 / (42 - 6)\n* 8 = 4 x 8 / (8 - 4) = 6 x 24 / (24 - 6) = 7 x 56 / (56 - 7)\n\nLooking at these examples, it  seems likely that there is only one solution when n is a prime. Let’s see why that is. If n is a prime and a < n, then n = a x b / (b - a) forces b to be a multiple of n, say b = n x c. Then n = a x nc / (nc - a) says that ac / (nc - a) = 1, which means ac = nc - a. Rewriting this we get nc = a(c + 1). Because n is a prime, we have c + 1 = n and a = c = n - 1. So a = n - 1 and b = n(n-1) is the only solution!"

Multiply both sides by 3 x B x D, so this becomes 3 x A x C = 2 x B x D. Look at this using the prime factors 2 and 3 – these must balance on the two sides of the equation. From 3, 6, 9, we have four factors of 3 to work with. From 2, 4, 6, 8 we have seven factors of 2 to work with. There are two cases for handling the 3’s.\n\n**Case 1:** Neither A nor C is 3 or 6, and B is 3 or 6.\n* B=3: 3 x A x C = 2 x 3 x D reduces to A x C = 2 x D. Solutions to this are 1 x 4 = 2 x 2 and 1 x 8 = 2 x 4.\n* B=6: 3 x A x C = 2 x 6 x D reduces to A x C = 4 x D. The solution to this is 1 x 8 = 4 x 2.\n\n**Case 2:** A is 3 or 6, and B is 9.\n* A=3: 3 x 3 x C = 2 x 9 x D reduces to C = 2 x D - the options for (C, D) are (2, 1), (4, 2), and (8, 4).\n* A=6: 3 x 6 x C = 2 x 9 x D reduces to C = D, which is impossible.\n\nSo, the solutions to the problem are given by:\n\n* (1 x 4) / (3 x 2)\n* (1 x 8) / (3 x 4)\n* (1 x 8) / (6 x 2)\n* (3 x 2) / (9 x 1)\n* (3 x 4) / (9 x 2)\n* (3 x 8) / (9 x 4)\n\n**Part 2:** A/B x C/D ~ 5/11. Multiply both sides by 11 x B x D to turn this into 11 x A x C ~ 5 x B x D. We want to find multiples of 11 that are close to multiples of 5 and that can be produced using 1 to 9. \n\nHere is the list to consider. These are multiples that are 1 apart and are producible using 1 to 9: 11 x 4 ~ 8 x 5; 11 x 9 ~ 20 x 5; and 11 x 16 ~ 35 x 5. The bigger the numbers are, the better, so let’s look at this last one.\n\n(2 x 8) / (5 x 7) = 16 / 35 is very close to 5/11 - they differ by 1 / (35 x 11) = 1 / 385.\n\nPerhaps the multiples that are two or three apart will work out better? There do not seem to be any candidates that would be an improvement."

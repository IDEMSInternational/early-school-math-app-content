That exploration involves a lot of good experiences, and there is no reason to avoid it.\n\nIf you want to be more systematic, the first question is: What is the common sum for these pairs of numbers? The five pairs have the same sum, and when we add them all up we get the same thing as adding the numbers up from 0 to 9. The sum from 0 to 9 is 45, so when we divide that by 5 we get 9 - the sum for each pair must be 9. Once that is established, the rest is simple:\n\n0 + 9 = 1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5.\n\n**Exploration:** The first step is to see whether the sum of the range of numbers can be broken into that many equal pieces. Also, note that it makes no difference whether we start at 0 or 1, so we’ll just look at starting at 0.\n\n**0 to 7 using 4 pairs:** The sum of the numbers from 0 to 7 is 28.

Dividing 36 into 3 triplets gives a sum of 12 for each triplet. The triplets will be largely driven by the three largest numbers (6, 7, 8), no two of which can be in a triplet together.

This produces triplets (8, 0, 4), (7, 2, 3), and (6, 1, 5). This could also be done as (8, 1, 3), (7, 0, 5), and (6, 2, 4).\n\n**0 to 9 using 2 groups of 5:** The sum from 0 to 9 is 45. 45 cannot be divided evenly into two equal groups!\n\nThe very interested child may want to go exploring further to see more examples of when this works and when it doesn’t. What fun!"

You can produce all squares of this size in the grid by shifting this starter square around. You have the choice of moving it to the right or down the remaining number of positions.

Because there are only 5 rows, no square can be bigger than 4 by 4.\n* 1 by 1 squares: 4 x 6 = 24\n* 2 by 2 squares: 3 x 5 = 15\n* 3 by 3 squares: 2 x 4 = 8\n* 4 by 4 squares: 1 x 3 = 3\n\nThe total number of squares is 24 + 15 + 8 + 3 = 50."

Note that there are two coins that are flipped three times instead of just once.\n\nIn the Challenge, n = 9 and k = 5. The first time 5 evenly divides 9 + (2 x extras) is for 9 + 2 x 3 = 15. It will take three turns, and there will be three coins that are flipped an extra two times.\n\nIf n is odd and k is even, it will be impossible. That’s because an even number will never evenly divide an odd number plus (2 x extras), which is an odd number.\n\nNote that some care needs to be exercised in simply assuming that just because k even divides n + (2 x extras) that it will work. For example, let n = 4 and k = 3. 3 evenly divides 4 + 2 x 1 = 6. However, it is not possible to do this in two turns. It will take four turns where 3 evenly divides 4 + 2 x 4 = 12."

Because a domino has an even number of squares, every time a domino is put on a board, the number of available squares is reduced by an even number. Therefore, if there were an even number of squares available before the domino, it will still be even after the domino, and if there were an odd number of squares before the domino, it will still be odd.\n\nFor the introductory examples at the top of the first page, the first example has an even number of squares, so it is numerically possible to end with 0 squares (which is an even number). The second example starts with an odd number of squares, so it is impossible for it to be covered with dominoes.\n\nThe second formula is to take the difference between the number of dark squares and the number of light ones. When a domino is put on the board, it covers a dark square and a light square, so the difference of those counts stays the same. For example, the difference is 8 - 6 = 2 before any dominoes are placed (looking at the first challenge board), and it will be 7 - 5 = 2 after placing a domino. A formula such as this, that does not change during moves in a game or puzzle, is called an invariant.\n\nBecause the difference starts at 8 - 6 = 2 for the first challenge board, it can never be completely covered by dominoes (which would bring the difference to 0 - 0 = 0).\n\nThe second board starts with a difference 7 - 7 = 0, so there is a chance that it can be covered. It is actually quite easy to cover the second board with dominoes.\n\n**Exploration:** Calculating the difference of dark and white squares tells you a lot about which boards can be done. The only difference that gives a chance for success is a difference of 0. If you were to remove four squares, it is possible to have a difference of 0 and not be able to cover the remaining squares - this happens when one of the corner squares gets isolated.

The advantage of using this form of the puzzle is that no negative numbers will be involved.\n\nA few easy notes to start with. All differences are nonnegative, so the final answer can never be less than 0. The numbers that get created from differences are either with the original numbers or from numbers derived from those numbers. So the maximum number that can be used with a difference is the largest number, which is 5. We want to know which of the numbers from 0 to 5 are possible final answers.\n\nLook at this as an evens and odds problem. Start by counting the number of odd numbers. In the case of going from 1 to 5, that count is 3, which is itself an odd number. So, we have an odd number of odd numbers. Make a list of what happens when you take a difference: 1) If both numbers are even, the result is an even number and there is no change in the total number of odd numbers; 2) if one number is odd and the other is even, the result is an odd number and there is no change in the total number of odd numbers; and 3) if both numbers are odd numbers, then the result is an even number and the total number of odd numbers is reduced by two. In all cases, the total number of odd numbers either stays the same or is reduced by two. \n\n**Result:** If we start with an odd number of odd numbers, we will end with an odd number (1) of them. If we start with an even number of odd numbers, then we will end with an even number (0) of them.\n\nIn the case of going from 1 to 5, we started with an odd number of odd numbers, so the final answer must be odd. The final answer must be 1,3 or 5. Some quick experimenting shows that they are all possible.\n\nThe analysis is exactly the same for the numbers from 1 to 6 because there are still three odd numbers.\n\nFor the range 1 to 7, there are now an even number of odd numbers, so there will be zero odd numbers at the end and the  possible last numbers are 0, 2, 4, or 6 (which can all occur).\n\n**Exploration:** It is easy to see when 0 is possible. Start by pairing up consecutive numbers from the top and taking their differences. This gives a collection of 1’s. If there are an even number of 1’s, then you can get a 0, and if there are an odd number, you can get a 1. Not surprisingly, this is the same as finding out whether you started with an even or odd number of odd numbers. Take 1 to 7 as an example: (7 6) (5 4) (3 2) 1 => 1 1 1 1 => (1 1) (1 1) => 0 0 => 0.\n\nYou can do the same thing to see if the top number is possible. Pair up consecutive numbers starting at the top leaving out the top number. Take the differences of these pairs. You now have a list of 1’s together with the top number. Reduce the list of 1’s to either a single 0 or single 1. Take the difference of that with the top number!"

The digits count the digits of each type, so the sum of the digits counts all the digits.\n\n**Result 2:** The sum of the products is the number of digits. Put another way, if you take the sum of multiplying each digit by the size of the digits it is counting, that sum must be the number of digits. This result follows from Result 1 because the sum of the products counts up all the digits involved in the number.\n\nLook at the two given examples. In 1210, the sum of the products is (1 x 0) + (2 x 1) + (1 x 2) + (0 x 3) = 4. In 2020, the sum is (2 x 0) + (0 x 1) + (2 x 2) + (0 x 3) = 4.\n\n**Result 3:** The rightmost, low-order digit, the ones digit, is 0. From Result 2, this digit must be 0 or 1 (or the product would be too large). Suppose it is 1. To avoid using variables, let’s suppose we have a 6-digit number. Then the ones place counts the number of 5’s. If there is a 5 someplace, then, by result 1, the only other non-zero digit must be a 1. But then we would have four 0’s, which is impossible.\n\n**Result 4:** The high-order digit is not 0. This must be true for this number to be considered a number.\nOkay, let’s construct some answers for 5-digit numbers.\n\nThere is a basic tension between results 1 and 2. To keep those sums the same, there must be an increase in 0’s. For example, for each 2 there must be an extra 0, for each 3 there must be two extra 0’s, for each 4 there must be three extra 0’s, and so on. That’s why most self-describing numbers have a lot of 0’s.\n\nIf the number of 0’s were 1, there would need to be nonzero numbers in every place except the far right place. But having all those nonzero numbers would necessitate having more 0’s to make Result 2 work out. So, having only one zero in numbers with more than four digits is impossible. We can call that Result 5 if you like.\n\nIf there are 2 0’s, the number is either 22100 or 21200. Of those, only 21200 works, and that is the answer!\n\nIf there are 3 0’s, the number would be 32000, which doesn’t work.\n\n**Exploration:** Let’s look at the cases individually. Remember the four results when looking at these.\n\n**1 digit:** Results 3 and 4 make this impossible.\n\n**2 digit:** The number would have to be 20,  which is not self describing.\n\n**3 digit:** The number would have to be either 300, 210, or 120. None of these is self describing."

Looking at this, it is tempting to think that the number of nonzero entries is four for numbers with at least six digits. From Result 7, we know that the number of nonzero entries cannot be less than four. Can it be more than four?\n\nWe immediately know two of the nonzero entries - the high order digit that gives the number of 0’s (which is a number that is at least 3), and the place that corresponds to that digit - if that place has a value greater than 1, then that causes there to be that many 0’s and that many of some other number, and things quickly spiral out of control. So, there is at least one 1. That gives us three nonzero entries. It is now impossible to have a single 1 (how would we fill in the number of 1’s), so the number of 1’s must be at least two. So we get an additional 1 corresponding to the place that has the number of 1’s.\n\nAnd that’s it. Any additional entries would once again cause a snowball effect that would cause the numbers to get too big. At last, we arrive at the answer.\n\nThe answer for 10 is 6210001000!\n\n**Exploration:** The answer for 7 was 3211000 and the answer for 10 was 6210001000. The pattern X210….01000 looks promising. Let’s look at how we can apply it.\nIt looks like, as we go up from 7, we can increase the number of 0’s by 1 each time, and put that new 0 between the two 1’s. If you check it out, it always works. Well, it works until we get to 13 with 9210000001000. After 13, the first digit becomes too large to be a single digit, but it was fun while it lasted."

Because the sum of the numbers from 1 to 6 is 21, we can subtract the sum of the tens column from 21 to see what the sum of the ones column will be. In all there can be only three possible sums to consider: \n\n* The tens column sums to 8 and the ones column sums to 13, which gives an overall sum of 93.\n* The tens column sums to 9 and the ones column sums to 12, which gives an overall sum of 102.\n* The tens column sums to 10 and the ones column sums to 11, which gives an overall sum of 111.\n\nOf these 102 is the best. Any combination of digits in the tens column that sums to 9 will give the best possible answer. The things that work are 1 + 2 + 6, 1 + 3 + 5, and 2 + 3 + 4.\n\nHere are some typical answers all of which sum to 102: 13 + 24 + 65, 16 + 34 + 52, and 21 + 35 + 46.\n\n**Exploration:** The analysis for the numbers from 1 to 7 is nearly the same as before. We still want the tens column to add up to 8, 9, or 10. The sum of the remaining digits will have some variability thanks to the wider range.\n\n* The tens column sums to 8. The largest that 3 of the remaining 4 numbers can sum to is 17 (4 + 6 + 7), with overall sum 97.\n* The tens column sums to 9. The smallest that 3 of the remaining 4 numbers can sum to is 12, with overall sum 102. The same answer as using the numbers from 1 to 6. The 7 is of no use here.\n* The tens column sums to 10.

If we use 1 + 3 + 4 in the tens column, then we can use 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 in the ones column. We can hit 100 exactly!\n\nSo, one best answer for 1 to 8 is 15 + 37 + 48 = 100.

For young students, there is absolutely no need to go into any kind of careful analysis. What follows is a more analytical way to find the solutions.\n\n**Common Sum:** The simplest way to start analyzing this puzzle is to find the common sum. Each row adds up to the common sum. Also, the three rows contain the numbers from 0 to 8 and add up to three times the common sum. Therefore, three times the common sum is 36 (the sum of 0 to ), so the common sum is 12.\n\n**Central Square:** The next step is to add up the four lines that go through the center square. The common sum is 12 and there are four lines, so their sum must be 4 x 12 = 48. Alternatively, the four lines contain every number once, plus the central square three more times. The sum of the numbers from 0 to 8 is 36. So, 48 equals 36 plus 3 times the central square. So, the central square must be 4.\n\n**Adding up to 12:** There are surprisingly few ways to add up to 12. They are:\n\n(0 4 8) (1 4 7) (2 4 6) (3 4 5) (0 5 7) (1 3 8) (1 5 6) (2 3 7)\n\nYou can figure out a lot for this list. Look at how often a number appears in a triplet:\n\n* 4 times: 4\n* 3 times: 1, 3, 5, 7\n* 2 times: 0, 2, 6, 8\n\nNext, compare this to how many times a square in the diagram is in one of the lines. You’ll see that the center square is in four lines, the corner squares are in three lines, and the middle of the sides are in two lines. This is another way to see that the center square must be 4. Also, the corners must be 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the middle of the sides must be 0, 2, 6, and 8.\n\n**Fill up the Square:** The hard work is done. Start with 4 in the middle and put 7 in one corner. Note that 0 must go next to the 7 on one side or the other (otherwise the 8 would be forced next to the 7) . You will have no choices after that. One answer, by rows, is: (7 0 5) (2 4 6) (3 8 1). Notice that this is the same as any other answer by rotating the square and possibly flipping it.\n\n**Exploration:** As noted in the last paragraph, all the solutions are essentially the same - rotate the square until the 7’s are in the same corner, and take the mirror image (if needed) along the diagonal to put the 0 in the same position.\n\nSolving this puzzle for 1 to 9 would mean adding 1 to every entry in the 0 to 8 solution. Solving this puzzle for 2 to 18 would mean doubling all the entries for the 1 to 9 solution."

Notice that this is the same as any other answer by rotating the square and possibly flipping it.\n\n**Exploration:** As noted in the last paragraph, all the solutions are essentially the same - rotate the square until the 7’s are in the same corner, and take the mirror image (if needed) along the diagonal to put the 0 in the same position.\n\nSolving this puzzle for 1 to 9 would mean adding 1 to every entry in the 0 to 8 solution. Solving this puzzle for 2 to 18 would mean doubling all the entries for the 1 to 9 solution."

Because of this, we only need to look for values of Sum up to 16 - the remaining larger values can be obtained by subtracting those solution entries from 8.\n\nThe smallest A + B + C + 2 x M can be is 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 x 1 = 11. So the smallest Sum can be is (28 + 11) / 3 = 13. Consequently, we want to see which of the Sum values from 13 to 16 are possible. It turns out that they are all possible. \n\nHere is one solution for each Sum value starting at 13 and ending at 16. There are many more."

That exploration involves a lot of good experiences, and there is no reason to avoid it.\n\nIf you want to be more systematic, the first question is: What is the common sum for these pairs of numbers? The five pairs have the same sum, and when we add them all up we get the same thing as adding the numbers up from 0 to 9. The sum from 0 to 9 is 45, so when we divide that by 5 we get 9 - the sum for each pair must be 9. Once that is established, the rest is simple:\n\n0 + 9 = 1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5.\n\n**Exploration:** The first step is to see whether the sum of the range of numbers can be broken into that many equal pieces. Also, note that it makes no difference whether we start at 0 or 1, so we’ll just look at starting at 0.\n\n**0 to 7 using 4 pairs:** The sum of the numbers from 0 to 7 is 28. Dividing 28 into 4 pairs gives a sum of 7 for each pair.\n\nThis is simple enough: 7 = 0 + 7 = 1 + 6 = 2 + 5 = 3 + 4.\n\n**0 to 2n - 1 using n pairs:** After looking at 0 to 7 and 0 to 9, the pattern is clear: write n as the n possible sums.\n\n**0 to 8 using 3 triplets:** The sum from 0 to 8 is 36. Dividing 36 into 3 triplets gives a sum of 12 for each triplet. The triplets will be largely driven by the three largest numbers (6, 7, 8), no two of which can be in a triplet together. This produces triplets (8, 0, 4), (7, 2, 3), and (6, 1, 5). This could also be done as (8, 1, 3), (7, 0, 5), and (6, 2, 4).\n\n**0 to 9 using 2 groups of 5:** The sum from 0 to 9 is 45. 45 cannot be divided evenly into two equal groups!\n\nThe very interested child may want to go exploring further to see more examples of when this works and when it doesn’t.

Once that is established, the rest is simple:\n\n0 + 9 = 1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5.\n\n**Exploration:** The first step is to see whether the sum of the range of numbers can be broken into that many equal pieces. Also, note that it makes no difference whether we start at 0 or 1, so we’ll just look at starting at 0.\n\n**0 to 7 using 4 pairs:** The sum of the numbers from 0 to 7 is 28. Dividing 28 into 4 pairs gives a sum of 7 for each pair.\n\nThis is simple enough: 7 = 0 + 7 = 1 + 6 = 2 + 5 = 3 + 4.\n\n**0 to 2n - 1 using n pairs:** After looking at 0 to 7 and 0 to 9, the pattern is clear: write n as the n possible sums.\n\n**0 to 8 using 3 triplets:** The sum from 0 to 8 is 36. Dividing 36 into 3 triplets gives a sum of 12 for each triplet. The triplets will be largely driven by the three largest numbers (6, 7, 8), no two of which can be in a triplet together. This produces triplets (8, 0, 4), (7, 2, 3), and (6, 1, 5). This could also be done as (8, 1, 3), (7, 0, 5), and (6, 2, 4).\n\n**0 to 9 using 2 groups of 5:** The sum from 0 to 9 is 45. 45 cannot be divided evenly into two equal groups!\n\nThe very interested child may want to go exploring further to see more examples of when this works and when it doesn’t. What fun!"

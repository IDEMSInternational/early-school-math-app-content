As the sum of the three circles, the sum is 3 x Sum. As the sum of all six numbers plus A, B, and C the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + A + B + C. The two things are equal, so that gives us 3 x Sum = 21 + A + B + C. Dividing by 3, we have Sum = 7 + (A + B + C)/3.\n\nFor Sum to be an integer in this last equation, A + B + C must be evenly divisible by 3. This allows for only four possibilities for A + B + C - it is either 6, 9, 12, or 15, and the corresponding values for Sum are 9, 10, 11, or 12.\n\nThe four solutions given here have Sum values of 9, 10, 11, and 12. As we shall see, these are all of the solutions!",
      "block4_text": "To save some work, note that if we take one solution and subtract all the entries from 7, we get another solution. Also, note that the new solution will have a Sum value which is 21 - (old Sum). Hence, the solutions for Sum values 9 and 10 give us the solutions for Sum values 11 and 12.\n\nIf A + B + C = 6, then A, B, and C are 1, 2, and 3, and Sum = 9.  That is the upper left solution.\n\nIf A + B + C = 9, then Sum = 10 and (A, B, C) is (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 5), or (2, 3, 4). If you check it, (1, 2, 6) and (2, 3, 4) are impossible. This leaves the upper right solution as the only Sum = 10 solution.\n\nIf you compare “Equal Sums – 2” with “Magic Triangles – 1,” you will see that they are the same puzzle!"

This will always work and produces (m - 1) + 2 x (m - 1) = 3 x (m - 1) X’s for an m by m square grid. This method for filling in the square can then be extended (by adding a single X in each new column) to anything with m rows to give 3 x (m - 1) + (n - m) = n + 2m - 3 X’s, when m < n.

However, that should not keep a student from playing around with it and learning a lot of interesting things along the way.\n\nSuppose the grid has m rows and n columns. In Avoiding Rectangles – 1, we found the following results for the best answers.\n\n**1 and 2 rows:** We had m + n - 1 X’s\n\n**3 rows:** We had m + n X’s using a starting diagram for a 3 by 3 grid that looked like the following diagram. Using that diagram, if we had 3 rows with more columns, we can just add a single X in each new column.",

To state the obvious, we want to create a collection of columns that never share a pair of rows with X’s in them.\n\nOne strategy is to fill in everything in the leftmost column except the bottom square, and then the rest of the columns have one X in the bottom row and one X in another row. This will always work and produces (m - 1) + 2 x (m - 1) = 3 x (m - 1) X’s for an m by m square grid. This method for filling in the square can then be extended (by adding a single X in each new column) to anything with m rows to give 3 x (m - 1) + (n - m) = n + 2m - 3 X’s, when m < n. This formula works for all the answers for any size grid (with more than 1 row) so far.",

Ignoring mirror images will reduce the number of solutions to consider by half. \n\nFor example, we can assume that not only is the 6 in the bottom row, but it is either in the middle or the right side of the bottom row - if it were on the left side, we could take the mirror image of the whole puzzle and put it on the right side.\n\nUsing this thinking, the bottom row can have five possible layouts (up to using mirror images):    5 X 6,   X 5 6,    X 6 5,    X 1 6,    X 6 1.\n\nAt this point, it is a matter of working through the various possibilities.

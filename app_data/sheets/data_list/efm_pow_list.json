So, either 5 goes directly above the 6 (with the 1 next to the 6), or 5 is in the bottom row.\n\nAt this point it is useful to consider what makes solutions different. Because the mirror image of any solution is also a solution, it makes sense to ignore those. Ignoring mirror images will reduce the number of solutions to consider by half. \n\nFor example, we can assume that not only is the 6 in the bottom row, but it is either in the middle or the right side of the bottom row - if it were on the left side, we could take the mirror image of the whole puzzle and put it on the right side.\n\nUsing this thinking, the bottom row can have five possible layouts (up to using mirror images):    5 X 6,   X 5 6,    X 6 5,    X 1 6,    X 6 1.\n\nAt this point, it is a matter of working through the various possibilities. The only 5 X 6 that works is 5 2 6. It turns out X 5 6 never works. The only X 6 5 is 2 6 5. The only X 1 6 is 4 1 6, and the only X 6 1 is 4 6 1.\n\nSo, ignoring mirror images, there are four solutions:"

To balance those two things, we can add them both up and divide by two - the smallest the single number on the left can be is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 2 = 7 ½. So the sum will either be 8 or 9, which we can try out individually.\n\nIf it’s 8, we have 1 solution:\n\n* 8 = 1 + 7 does not work\n* 8 = 2 + 6 = 1 + 3 + 4 works!\n* 8 = 3 + 5 = does not work\n\nFor 9, we have 3 solutions:\n\n* 9 = 1 + 8 = 2 + 3 + 4 works!\n* 9 = 2 +7 = 1 + 3 + 5 works!\n* 9 = 3 + 6 does not work\n* 9 = 4 + 5 = 1 + 2 + 6 works!\n\n**Exploration:** We saw above that 1 to 8 gives one solution. The range from 1 to 10 will give us many more new solutions.\n\n* 10 = 1 + 9 = 2 + 3 + 5 works!\n* 10 = 2 + 8 = 1 + 2 + 7 = 1 + 3 + 6 = 1 + 4 + 5 - 3 ways!\n* 10 = 3 + 7 = 1 + 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 5 - 2 ways!\n* 10 = 4 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 7 = 2 + 3 + 5 - 2 ways!"

To make that triple sum as small as possible, we could attempt to use the numbers 1 through 6 for them.

That exploration involves a lot of good experiences, and there is no reason to avoid it.\n\nIf you want to be more systematic, the first question is: What is the common sum for these pairs of numbers? The five pairs have the same sum, and when we add them all up we get the same thing as adding the numbers up from 0 to 9. The sum from 0 to 9 is 45, so when we divide that by 5 we get 9 - the sum for each pair must be 9. Once that is established, the rest is simple:\n\n0 + 9 = 1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5.\n\n**Exploration:** The first step is to see whether the sum of the range of numbers can be broken into that many equal pieces. Also, note that it makes no difference whether we start at 0 or 1, so we’ll just look at starting at 0.\n\n**0 to 7 using 4 pairs:** The sum of the numbers from 0 to 7 is 28. Dividing 28 into 4 pairs gives a sum of 7 for each pair.\n\nThis is simple enough: 7 = 0 + 7 = 1 + 6 = 2 + 5 = 3 + 4.\n\n**0 to 2n - 1 using n pairs:** After looking at 0 to 7 and 0 to 9, the pattern is clear: write n as the n possible sums.\n\n**0 to 8 using 3 triplets:** The sum from 0 to 8 is 36. Dividing 36 into 3 triplets gives a sum of 12 for each triplet. The triplets will be largely driven by the three largest numbers (6, 7, 8), no two of which can be in a triplet together.

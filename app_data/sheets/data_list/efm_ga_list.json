One player, usually the less experienced, is given the choice of going first or second.\n\n**Play:** Players take turns subtracting one or two from the current number and updating the number on the paper.\n\n**Goal:** The player who makes the current number 0 wins.\n\n**Example:** The weaker player, cleverly, elects to go first. The players make the following moves: \n* (1) 10 - 1 = 9. \t(2) 9 - 2 = 7, \n* (1) 7 - 1 = 6, \t(2) 6 - 1 = 5,\n* (1) 5 - 2 = 3, \t(2) 3 - 1 = 2, \n* (1) wins with 2 - 2 = 0!",
      "block2_text": "This is an ideal activity for practicing the problem solving technique of “Learn from simpler versions of a problem.” Lead a discussion where you keep track of who wins if you start at 1, at 2, at 3, at 4, at 5, at 6. What is the pattern that emerges?",
      "block3_text": "**Piles of objects:** If your players are not comfortable with numerals yet, use a pile of objects. Remove objects from the pile with each move until no objects are left and you have a winner.\n\n**Number line:** Use a marker on a number line. Start the marker at 10 and slide it one or two places to the left with each move.\n\n**Adding:** Practice adding by starting with 0 and adding 1 or 2 for each turn. The player who reaches the target number wins.\n\n**Target loses:** You can play that the player who is forced to 0 (or the target number) is the loser.\n\n**Target number:** Use smaller target numbers for beginning players and larger target numbers for more experienced players.\n\n**Different step sizes:** For the upper grades in this range, Instead of adding or subtracting 1 and 2, use other groups of numbers. Use 1, 2, and 3; or even 1, 2, and 4."

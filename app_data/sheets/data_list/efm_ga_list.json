The students may want paper or some other surface for writing things down.\n\n**Play:** Create random numbers with dice or playing cards. I’ll assume you are using dice. Start by creating a two-digit target number. Roll a die once for the tens digit, and then roll it again for the ones digit. If you need to use smaller numbers, roll for the tens digit until you are within your range.\n\nNext, create five one-digit numbers. You can either roll a group of five dice once, or you can roll one die five times. In either event, write the five digits on the board.\n\n**Challenge:** Use any operation, including forming two-digit numbers, to use all five digits to get as close as possible to the target number. If your students are not comfortable with multiplication and division yet, then restrict the operations to addition and subtraction.\n\n**Example:** Suppose the roll is: 4, 4, 3, 1, 3 and 22. One player might get 4 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 15. Another player might use 14 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 24. Someone else might have 34 - 14 + 3 = 23.

The students may want paper or some other surface for writing things down.\n\n**Play:** Create random numbers with dice or playing cards. I’ll assume you are using dice. Start by creating a two-digit target number. Roll a die once for the tens digit, and then roll it again for the ones digit. If you need to use smaller numbers, roll for the tens digit until you are within your range.\n\nNext, create five one-digit numbers. You can either roll a group of five dice once, or you can roll one die five times. In either event, write the five digits on the board.\n\n**Challenge:** Use any operation, including forming two-digit numbers, to use all five digits to get as close as possible to the target number. If your students are not comfortable with multiplication and division yet, then restrict the operations to addition and subtraction.\n\n**Example:** Suppose the roll is: 4, 4, 3, 1, 3 and 22. One player might get 4 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 15. Another player might use 14 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 24. Someone else might have 34 - 14 + 3 = 23. If you allow multiplication, then 4 x 4 + 3 x 1 + 3 = 22 or (3 - 1) x (4 + 4 + 3) = 22 work out exactly.\n\n**Goal:** Be the first to find the solution, or find the closest solution.",

Some will build up starting with the given numbers, and others will work backwards from the target. Work backwards by starting with the target and unraveling it (using the earlier example): Subtract 4 from 22 to get 18. Next, divide 18 by 3 to get 6. Now use 4, 3, and 1 to get 6 by doing 4 + 3 - 1 = 6. In the end, we have 4 + 3 x (4 + 3 - 1) = 22.",

One answer for where to put the parentheses is: 10 - (3 - (5 - 2) + 8 - 4) = 6.\n\n**Create:** Create these puzzles by taking any equation, such as 9 = (2 + 7) x (5 - 2 x 2) and remove the parentheses. The challenge for your child is how to take 2 + 7 x 5 - 2 x 2 and add parentheses to it so that the result is 9.",

      "block1_text": "**Set up:** Put your students in a circle.\n\n**Play:** Start counting around the circle starting at 1. For each number, state the number, and then give its prime factorization. If the number is a unit or a prime, say that instead of the prime factorization. Make a habit of saying the primes in the factorization in increasing size – for example, saying that 12 is 2 squared x 3, and not 2 x 3 x 2 or 3 x 2 squared - this will keep them organized and easier to understand and fit together.\n\nIf done correctly, you should hear: \n\n* 1 - unit\t\t\n* 2 - prime\t\n* 3 - prime\t\n* 4 - 2 squared\n* 5 - prime\t\n* 6 - 2 x 3\t\n* 7 - prime\t\n* 8 - 2 cubed\n* 9 - 3 squared \t\n* 10 - 2 x 5 \t\n* 11 - prime\t\n* 12 - 2 squared x 3\n* 13 - prime\t\n* 14 - 2 x 7\t\n* 15 - 3 x 5\t\n* 16 - 2 to the fourth\n* 17 ...\n\n**Goal:** See how high your group can get before it starts slowing down.",
      "block2_text": "Understanding and being comfortable with prime factorizations is incredibly helpful. It provides insights into how numbers are put together multiplicatively. It is key to doing fraction work where being able to find common factors and common multiples is so important. Stating prime factorizations using powers also provides excellent practice with exponents.\n\nWhen someone gets stuck, give them ideas for how to get unstuck. For example, point out that the number is even (so it’s divisible by 2), or that it ends in 0 or 5 (so it’s divisible by 5)."

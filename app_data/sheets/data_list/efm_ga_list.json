Choose roles – one player is the Puzzler and the other is the Questioner. The Puzzler starts by saying “I’m thinking of a number between 1 and <#>.” \n\n**Play:** The Questioner asks questions of the form: “How does your number compare to <#>?” The Puzzler answers by saying that their number is greater than, equal to, or less than that number.\n\n**Goal:** The Questioner tries to guess the Puzzler’s number with as few questions as possible.\n\n**Example game:** The Puzzler thinks of 6 and starts with “I’m thinking of a number between 1 and 10.”\n\n* Questioner: “How does your number compare to 5?” – Puzzler: “My number is greater than 5.” \n* Questioner: “How does your number compare to 7?” – Puzzler: “My number is less than 7.” \n* Questioner: “How does your number compare to 6?” – Puzzler:“Congratulations, my number is equal to 6!”",

The player with the lowest total wins.\n\n**Extend:** Use an extended range of numbers, say up to 100.\n\n**Number line:** Use a number line to keep track of the information and to practice with a number line. Each time a question is answered, mark off the numbers that are no longer possible. For example, if the range is 0 to 12 and the number is larger than 6, then the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are crossed off."

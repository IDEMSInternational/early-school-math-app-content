For example, a right rectangular prism is another name for a box.

Addition and multiplication have the commutative property, but subtraction and division do not. For example, 2 + 4 = 4 + 2; 2 x 4 = 4 x 2; 4 - 2 ≠ 2 - 4, and 4 / 2 ≠ 2 / 4.\n\nThe **associative property** says that an operation applied to three things will create the same result no matter which of the two possible groupings (associations) is used. Addition and multiplication satisfy the associative property, and subtraction and division do not. For example (2 + 3) + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 and 2 + (3 + 7) = 2 + 10 = 12. Similarly, (2 x 3) x 7 = 6 x 7 = 42 and 2 x (3 x 7) = 2 x 21 = 42.\n\nMultiplication is said to **distribute over** addition or subtraction. For example, (2 + 3) x 7 = 2 x 7 + 3 x 7. Similarly, putting the multiplication first, 7 x (3 -2) = 7 x 3 - 7 - 2. Division also distributes over addition or subtraction, but only on the right side. For example, (6 + 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 + 4 / 2 and (6 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 - 4 / 2.\n\nSee also: **associative property,** **commutative property,** and **distributive property.**"

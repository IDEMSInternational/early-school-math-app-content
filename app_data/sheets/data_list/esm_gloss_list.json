After gathering that data, you might analyze it be asking which shape you have the most of and which shape you have the least.\n\nYou can make a simple T-chart using images of the shapes.

Teachers often prefer to have improper fractions rewritten as mixed numbers. For example, 22/7 = 3 1/7.\n\nCalling a fraction \"improper\" can be misleading. It suggests that it is never a good representation of a fraction. If you are multiplying fractions, it is usually easier to do the calculation if mixed numbers are rewritten as improper fractions. \n\nFor example, doing 22/7 x 3/5 is easier than 3 1/7 x 3/5.\n\nExamples of proper fractions:\n* 2/5\n* 0/3\n* 6/7"

Addition and multiplication have the commutative property, but subtraction and division do not. For example, 2 + 4 = 4 + 2; 2 x 4 = 4 x 2; 4 - 2 ≠ 2 - 4, and 4 / 2 ≠ 2 / 4.\n\nThe **associative property** says that an operation applied to three things will create the same result no matter which of the two possible groupings (associations) is used. Addition and multiplication satisfy the associative property, and subtraction and division do not. For example (2 + 3) + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 and 2 + (3 + 7) = 2 + 10 = 12. Similarly, (2 x 3) x 7 = 6 x 7 = 42 and 2 x (3 x 7) = 2 x 21 = 42.\n\nMultiplication is said to **distribute over** addition or subtraction. For example, (2 + 3) x 7 = 2 x 7 + 3 x 7. Similarly, putting the multiplication first, 7 x (3 -2) = 7 x 3 - 7 - 2. Division also distributes over addition or subtraction, but only on the right side. For example, (6 + 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 + 4 / 2 and (6 - 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 - 4 / 2.\n\nSee also: **associative property,** **commutative property,** and **distributive property.**"

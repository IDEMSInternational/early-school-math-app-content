This is not the case. The equal sign has no preferred side to it. Also, some people believe that one of the two sides of an equal sign should be a solitary number.

Addition and multiplication have the commutative property, but subtraction and division do not. For example, 2 + 4 = 4 + 2; 2 x 4 = 4 x 2; 4 - 2 ≠ 2 - 4, and 4 / 2 ≠ 2 / 4.\n\nThe **associative property** says that an operation applied to three things will create the same result no matter which of the two possible groupings (associations) is used. Addition and multiplication satisfy the associative property, and subtraction and division do not. For example (2 + 3) + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 and 2 + (3 + 7) = 2 + 10 = 12. Similarly, (2 x 3) x 7 = 6 x 7 = 42 and 2 x (3 x 7) = 2 x 21 = 42.\n\nMultiplication is said to **distribute over** addition or subtraction. For example, (2 + 3) x 7 = 2 x 7 + 3 x 7.

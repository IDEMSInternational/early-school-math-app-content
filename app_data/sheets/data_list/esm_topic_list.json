As your child mastered Counting On, some of that counting was replaced by starting with one of the numbers, say 3 in this example, and then counting the two remaining things (“4, 5”). This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Five Frames:** Start using five frames to provide a structured environment for learning these math facts, as well as to lead into learning number bonds and ten frames. Play up the connection of five frames with having five fingers on one hand.\n\n**Equation Symbols:** Start using “+” and “–” and “=” when you write down this material for your children. Also, don’t always write equalities with the “result” on the right. Writing “=” just means that the two sides are equal, not that the left side produces the right side. So,  5 – 1 = 4, 3 = 5 – 2,  and 1 + 3 = 5 – 1 are all good things to write and should be intermixed.\n\n< illustration of a five frame with 3 dots in it >\n\n**Zero is Important:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes. It is easy to do, and it is important conceptually. Similarly, mix in questions where you subtract 0 and questions where you subtract everything.

This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Five Frames:** Start using five frames to provide a structured environment for learning these math facts, as well as to lead into learning number bonds and ten frames. Play up the connection of five frames with having five fingers on one hand.\n\n**Equation Symbols:** Start using “+” and “–” and “=” when you write down this material for your children. Also, don’t always write equalities with the “result” on the right. Writing “=” just means that the two sides are equal, not that the left side produces the right side. So,  5 – 1 = 4, 3 = 5 – 2,  and 1 + 3 = 5 – 1 are all good things to write and should be intermixed.\n\n< illustration of a five frame with 3 dots in it >\n\n**Zero is Important:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes. It is easy to do, and it is important conceptually. Similarly, mix in questions where you subtract 0 and questions where you subtract everything.

As before, it will be tempting to rush these development levels, but they take time. For example, do not ask about where a story is going or how a character is feeling if the child is just beginning to identify balls and red objects.\n\n* **Level: Ask simple questions:** As your child begins to understand and say words, mix in simple questions. Freely help with answers as needed. If you point and say \"Is this red?\" and they don't know, supply the answer. If you say \"Count the blocks.\" and your child does not know how, point and count the blocks with them \"one, two, three.\" Ask simple, basic questions (“Is that a cat?” “What color is the tree?” “What is the dog doing?”) as you point to things on the current page of the story.\n\n* **Level: Ask more open-ended questions:** Begin to ask questions with less definite and simple answers. Questions such as “What is happening to the bird?” and “Do you think that is a fair way to split things up? invite broader answers and discussions. Expand on the child’s response to create further questions and discussion ideas. Fight the temptation to let your follow up questions slip into the next level.\n\n* **Level: Ask more sophisticated questions:** These questions may discuss the narrative of the story, such as what has happened so far or what will happen next, or they may relate back to the child’s life or world, such as do you like it when it rains. Also ask questions about a character’s inner life, such as what the character is feeling and have they ever felt like that. At this level, there should be much more give and take, and the child should be encouraged to put questions of their own into the dialogue."

Each part may take a while to be learned and there will be minor missteps along the way. Much of this is developmental and cannot be explicitly taught – instead, there needs to be exposure and practice until it clicks.\n\n* **Unchanging order** The counting sequence is always the same.\n* **One-to-one correspondence** Count a collection of objects by putting them in one-to-one correspondence with the numbers being said. The child can touch the objects as they count.\n* **The last number is the quantity** When counting a group of objects, the last spoken number is the quantity of objects.\n* **Order and rearrangement doesn’t change the count** The child can count the objects in any order, and the objects can be rearranged, and the count will always be the same.\n* **Subgroups of bigger groups have smaller counts**\n\n**Number Lines:** Use number lines to solidify number order and give a useful visual reference. Number lines should start from 0 and increase from left to right. Place these on walls, on paper, or on floors. On the ground, you can make a **number path,** which is a sequence of numbers big enough for a child to walk along. Use the number path for counting and for practicing addition and subtraction.",

Don’t treat the errors as remarkable."

This experience with counting also allows a child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n\n**Five Frames and Ten Frames:** Start using five frames and ten frames to provide a structured environment for learning these math facts, as well as to lead into learning number bonds.

So,  5 – 1 = 4, 3 = 5 – 2,  and 1 + 3 = 5 – 1 are all good things to write and should be intermixed.\n\n**Zero is Important:** Mix in adding 0 sometimes.

It’s much easier to say and understand the phrase “two to the fourth,” than to say “two times two times ... “ In 2<sup>4</sup> for example, the 2 is called the **base** and the 4 is called the **exponent.**\n\n**Special Names:** The second power, 4<sup>2</sup> for example, can be said **four squared,** and the third power, 4<sup>3</sup> for example, can be said **four cubed.** Any other power, such as 2<sup>8</sup> is said **two to the eighth.**\n\n**Exponents Add:** When powers of the same number are multiplied, a simple rule governs how to simplify the result – add the powers. For example, if you do 4<sup>2</sup> × 4<sup>3</sup> = (4 × 4) × (4 × 4 × 4) = 4<sup>5</sup>, we have two fours multiplied by three fours, so the result is five fours being multiplied.

Reading interactively and having a dialogue as you read with a child is called **Dialogic Reading.** Not only does this provide deeper engagement with the story, it also gives opportunities to explore concepts and vocabulary that you choose to connect with the story. It also gives the child more involvement and agency with the story telling.\n\nThe types of dialogues you have with a child depend very much on their level of development. Some of these considerations are similar to what you should consider when doing Math Talk with a child. It is often tempting to rush these development levels, but they simply take time and it is silly to ask about ideas that a child cannot relate to yet.\n\n* **A child who does not understand your words.** While this will be a very one-sided dialogue, it lays the foundation for future conversations. It is all about exposure at this level. **Point at and Describe** simple objects and characters in the story. When you point at things, name them and describe them by talking about properties like shape, color, relationships, and quantities. With more and more exposure, the child will start to pick up the concepts on their own timetable.\n\n* **A preverbal child who understands your words.** You are now able to **Point at, Describe, and Ask** about simple story elements and objects in the illustrations. The dialogue takes place by having the child point at the objects they understand but don’t have the words for yet. You can ask questions like “Where is the ball?” or respond to prompts like “Point at the red toy.”\n\nThe next three levels involve true dialogues between you and a verbal child. These will be discussed in the next topic and constitute the three classical levels of dialogic reading."

      "block1_text": "There is a big difference between just reading to a child and discussing what is going on as each page of a story is read with a child. Reading interactively and having a dialogue as you read with a child is called **Dialogic Reading.** Not only does this provide deeper engagement with the story, it also gives opportunities to explore concepts and vocabulary that you choose to connect with the story. It also gives the child more involvement and agency with the story telling.\n\nThe types of dialogues you have with a child depend very much on their level of development. Some of these considerations are similar to what you should consider when doing Math Talk with a child. It is often tempting to rush these development levels, but they simply take time and it is silly to ask about ideas that a child cannot relate to yet.\n\n* **A child who does not understand your words.** While this will be a very one-sided dialogue, it lays the foundation for future conversations. It is all about exposure at this level. **Point at and Describe** simple objects and characters in the story. When you point at things, name them and describe them by talking about properties like shape, color, relationships, and quantities. With more and more exposure, the child will start to pick up the concepts on their own timetable.\n\n* **A preverbal child who understands your words.** You are now able to **Point at, Describe, and Ask** about simple story elements and objects in the illustrations. The dialogue takes place by having the child point at the objects they understand but don’t have the words for yet. You can ask questions like “Where is the ball?” or respond to prompts like “Point at the red toy.”\n\nThe next three levels involve true dialogues between you and a verbal child. These will be discussed in the next topic and constitute the three classical levels of dialogic reading."

As before, it will be tempting to rush these development levels, but they take time. For example, do not ask about where a story is going or how a character is feeling if the child is just beginning to identify balls and red objects.\n\n* **Ask simple questions:** As your child begins to understand and say words, mix in simple questions. Freely help with answers as needed. If you point and say \"Is this red?\" and they don't know, supply the answer. If you say \"Count the blocks.\" and your child does not know how, point and count the blocks with them \"one, two, three.\" Ask simple, basic questions (“Is that a cat?” “What color is the tree?” “What is the dog doing?”) as you point to things on the current page of the story.\n\n* **Ask more open-ended questions:** Begin to ask questions with less definite and simple answers. Questions such as “What is happening to the bird?” and “Do you think that is a fair way to split things up? invite broader answers and discussions. Expand on the child’s response to create further questions and discussion ideas. Fight the temptation to let your follow up questions slip into the next level.\n\n* **Ask more sophisticated questions:** These questions may discuss the narrative of the story, such as what has happened so far or what will happen next, or they may relate back to the child’s life or world, such as do you like it when it rains. Also ask questions about a character’s inner life, such as what the character is feeling and have they ever felt like that. At this level, there should be much more give and take, and the child should be encouraged to put questions of their own into the dialogue."

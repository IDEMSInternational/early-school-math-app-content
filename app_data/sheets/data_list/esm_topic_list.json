Similarly, \"Point to the tree.\" or \"Point to a car.\" works for those two concepts.\n\n**Handling mistakes:** Ask all kinds of questions. Ask which of two things is bigger or smaller. Ask where you are walking to. Ask where something belongs. All these questions are opportunities for your child to express their understanding and for you to clear up any misconceptions. If your child points to the wrong thing or picks up the wrong thing, simply point out the right thing and don't try to explain their mistake to them.\n\n**Do this while reading:** Now you can add asking questions to your pointing and describing as you read a story. Point to pictures in the story and ask the same questions you would ask about the things around you.\n\n**Simple riddles:** Play games with your child's new skill and have fun with it.  Have fun unraveling puzzles together such as: \"There is something red under something blue. Where is it?\""

      "block1_text": "**Responding:** Once a child is able to respond to what you say, that will allow you to start asking questions. Your \"Point and Describe\" Math Talk wlll now become \"Point, Describe, and Ask.\" Even before a child can say words, they will start to respond nonverbally to you as they begin to make sense of your words.\n\n**Ask questions:** Use this new level of communication to make it clearer which ideas a child understands. \"Where is the bird?\" or \"Where is the ball? makes it clear if your child knows what a bird or ball is. Similarly, \"Point to the tree.\" or \"Point to a car.\" works for those two concepts.\n\n**Handling mistakes:** Ask all kinds of questions. Ask which of two things is bigger or smaller. Ask where you are walking to. Ask where something belongs. All these questions are opportunities for your child to express their understanding and for you to clear up any misconceptions. If your child points to the wrong thing or picks up the wrong thing, simply point out the right thing and don't try to explain their mistake to them.\n\n**Do this while reading:** Now you can add asking questions to your pointing and describing as you read a story. Point to pictures in the story and ask the same questions you would ask about the things around you.\n\n**Simple riddles:** Play games with your child's new skill and have fun with it.  Have fun unraveling puzzles together such as: \"There is something red under something blue. Where is it?\""

Discuss which of the four things is the most unusual.\n\nFor example, you could have pictures of some animals. Perhaps only one of them can fly. Maybe only one of them has two legs. This activity can provide fun challenges that let your child do some creative thinking with new concepts.\n\nAs another example, each of the following four shapes is different in some way from the other three. Shape 1 is a triangle, while the rest are squares. Shape 2 is the only one with a hole. Shape 3 is much smaller than the others. Shape 4 is blue while the others are red.",

Usually, a small collection of shapes is used, and often they are all regular polygons, though a great variety of kinds of shapes may be used.\n\n**Exploring** Theer are many sophisticated things to do with tilings; however, it is wonderful fun for a child to simply fit polygon shapes together and discover the shapes and patterns they create, without any particular end goal in mind. Your students will learn a lot in this unstructured form of play.\n\nIf you have access to pattern blocks, these our great for students to use to explore what can be done. If they are not available, use a stiff material such as cardboard, wood, or stiff paper to make poygons where the sides of all the shapes have a single length.",

It is handy to introduce it now for understanding numbers between 10 and 20, and it will become an essential tool for breaking apart and understanding numbers above 100.\n\n**Examples:** Expanded notation takes the contribution of each digit of a number, isolates it, and understands it in terms of its place value.\n* In 17, the one represents 10, so expand 17 as 10 + 7. \n* Similarly, 276 expands to 200 + 70 + 6.\n\nExpanded notation is extremely useful for learning arithmetic operations with multi-digit numbers. This will be an important tool and it should be developed fully and practiced thoroughly."

Once a student knows how to skip count reliably, they can calculate those multiplication facts with confidence. It is also great mental arithmetic practice.\n\n**Practice Up and Down:** Skip counting downward is helpful for practicing subtraction. It is also handy when it comes time to work on division.\n\n**Use Starting Points Other than Multiples:** Initially start only from 0 and other multiples of the skip count number. Once this is done confidently, practice from other starting points. This provides practice with other addition and subtraction facts, and it is useful for division later on. It also provides interesting variety.\n\n**Go beyond 2's:** At this point your students should be comfortable skip counting by 2's, starting from anywhere and going up or down. Start extending this to skip counting by other numbers. The two easiest ones are skip counting by 5's and 10's.\n\n**By 10's:** Not only is skip counting by 10's easy to do, it also provides practice with place value. Your students will quickly realize that, if they skip count by 10's starting at 3, all the numbers will have a 3 in the ones place and the only thing that changes is the tens place. If you have a 100 chart available, use it to show your students that all the numbers go down or up in one column of the chart.\n\n**By 5's:** After 10's, it is time to do the 5's. When your child skip counts by 5's, they will be comforted to see that every other number is 10 apart, as if they were skip counting by 10's.\n\n**Use Other Counts:** There is no hurry to do the other numbers. Skip counting by 9's can be fun because the ones place gets one smaller and the tens place gets one bigger with each step. Skip counting by 11's from 0 is quite easy."

It also provides interesting variety.\n\n**Go beyond 2's:** At this point your students should be comfortable skip counting by 2's, starting from anywhere and going up or down. Start extending this to skip counting by other numbers. The two easiest ones are skip counting by 5's and 10's.\n\n**By 10's:** Not only is skip counting by 10's easy to do, it also provides practice with place value. Your students will quickly realize that, if they skip count by 10's starting at 3, all the numbers will have a 3 in the ones place and the only thing that changes is the tens place. If you have a 100 chart available, use it to show your students that all the numbers go down or up in one column of the chart.\n\n**By 5's:** After 10's, it is time to do the 5's. When your child skip counts by 5's, they will be comforted to see that every other number is 10 apart, as if they were skip counting by 10's.\n\n**Use Other Counts:** There is no hurry to do the other numbers. Skip counting by 9's can be fun because the ones place gets one smaller and the tens place gets one bigger with each step. Skip counting by 11's from 0 is quite easy.",
      "block2_accord": "Have Fun With It",
      "block2_text": "This is something you can make into an activity to do with two or more people. Someone says a number to start with, what the skip size will be, and whether to go up or down. Then go around the group with each person saying the next number.\n\nOne of the nice things about skip counting is that it can be done anywhere and at any time that you have some spare time.",
      "block3_accord": "Patterns on a 100 Chart",
      "block3_text": "Look for patterns that show up as your studetns skip count. This is most easily done using a 100 chart, but you can also do it by writing the numbers in a column and watching what happens to the ones and tens digits as they march down the column. Some numbers, such as 8 and 9, have interesting patterns in their ones digits, and other numbers, such as 3, are not as interesting."

That the share size increases when the total increases should make a lot of sense.\n\n**Handling Remainders** Dividing something among any number of people is straightforward when it comes out evenly. When there are some things left over, much depends on the nature of the problem. Give your students enough real-world problems so that they stop just assuming that they can always use fractional amounts in their sharing.\n* If you share 7 apples 2 ways, then each person gets 3 1/2 apples.\n* If you want to split 7 people into 2 teams, then you are stuck.\n\n**Make Estimates and Use Bigger Steps** Look at splitting up 20 pebbles into 4 piles. One way to do that is to take one pebble at a time and put it in each pile to keep their amounts even. Another way is to start by taking out groups of 3 pebbles and putting them into the 4 piles and then deal with splitting up the remaining 8 pebbles of the 20 pebbles. This practice of making an initial estimate helps create the foundation for dividing larger amounts."

As we will see, this provides the foundation for why addition and subtraction of fractions with the same denominator work out simply.\n\n**Multiplication and Non-Unit Fractions** A non-unit fraction, such as 4/3, can also be described as 4 x 1/3. As we will see much later, this allows for easy explanations for how multiplication of a fraction by an integer works."

Thoughtful mistakes are an important part of the process. Highlight your own mistakes when they occur.\n* Students should respectuflly challenge the ideas of others (and gracefully accept those challenges), and listen to and build on the ideas of others.\n* Having a partial solution is useful.\n* Persistence and grit are powerful attributes. Putting a problem aside and coming back to it later can lead to fresh insights.\n* Everyone can see themselves as a math person.\n* The current puzzle can be a stepping stone in an exciting journey in related puzzles the students discover and explore.\n\n**Negative Attitudes to Change:**\n* People are either born with math talent or they are not.\n* I am a weak math student, so my ideas are generally useless.\n* Math work is lonely.\n* I will never use this math in my real life.\n* Only geniuses are capable of discovering or creating mathematics. \n* If I can't solve a problem in 2 minutes, it must require an expert.\n* Immediately after reading a problem statement, I should understand what is asked.\n* Attaining the answer is the most important aspect of problem solving.\n* Accept procedures at face value, use them, and don't try to understand why they work.\n* The math I learn in school is mostly facts and procedures that have to be memorized.\n* There is always a rule to follow in solving math problems.\n* Math problems have one and only one right answer, and only one way to get it."
